# Core Principle
- Pathogens can transfer FROM other channels INTO divergent channels
- Divergent Channels can influence ALL areas they connect to
- The flow goes BOTH WAYS: Imbalances flow in; treatment flows out

# Seven Clinical Applications
- Treat Conditions along divergent pathways
	- Divergent channels reach areas primary channels don'they
		- E.g. Spine or Internal organs directly
- Treat associated internal organs
	- Each Yin or Yang pair connects to related organs
	- Direct organ influence distinguishes them from muscle channels
- Treat primary channel conditions
	- Support Primary Channel treatments
- Treat Connecting (luo) Channel conditions
	- Especially emotional conditions
	- Blood channels hold emotions
- Treat Muscle (Sinew) channel conditions
	- Musculoskeletal issues, bi syndrome
- Treat Bone-level conditions
	- Connect to Eight Extraordinary Vessels
	- Influence Jing (Essence)

 # Layer Integration
- Divergent channels are unique because they influence:
	- Wei layer (superficial: skin, muscles)
	- Ying layer (middle: primary channels, organs)
	- Yuan layer (deep: extraordinary channels, jing)

# 8 Essential Qualities
1. Branch from primary channels
- Diverge at specific points
- Return to rejoin primary channels
2. Flow through major joints
- Joints are large spaces
- Spaces where pathogens can lodge
- Knees, hips, shoulders, elbows
3. Ascending flow
- Begin at knees (Bladder-Kidney)
- Move up to hip → chest → shoulders → throat → face
- Exception: San Jiao descends from head
- This ascending function moves substances and pathogens upward/outward
4. Move bidirectionally
- Outward movement: Releases pathogenic factors
- Inward movement: Reinforces organs, maintains latency
- Can guide body's substances to specific areas
5. Distribute qi to head region
- Neck, face, head, sensory organs
- All six pairs reach the head area
6. Flow superficially AND deeply
- Cover areas primary channels don't reach
- Influence wei (superficial), ying (middle), and yuan (deep) layers
7. Have no points of their own
- Share points with primary channels
- Pathway intersections become treatment points
8. Strengthen Yin-Yang connections
- Unite paired channels
- Can influence internal organs directly

# Roots and Ends
- Different from confluent points! These show where pathogens can enter divergent channels

| Channel | Root (Begin) | End | Anatomical Area |
| Tai Yang | BL-67 | BL-1 | Eyes |
| Shao Yang | GB-44 | SI-19 | Ear |
| Yang Ming | ST-45 | ST-8 | Corner of head |
| Tai Yin | SP-1 | Ren-12 | Stomach |
| Shao Yin | KD-1 | Ren-23 | Throat |
| Jue Yin | LV-1 | Ren-17 | Chest |

## Clinical Application
- Use BOTH confluent points AND root/end points
- Roots begin on extremities (no confluent points there)
- Provides additional treatment entry points

- From Ling Shu:
- For one who comprehends ends and beginnings, one sentence is enough.
- For one who does not understand ends and beginnings, the way of the needle is completely cut off.

# Always treat the entire pathway, not just 1-2 points!

## Luo Connecting Channels
- Emotions are stored in the blood, and the connecting channels treat blood.
	- Connecting channels treat emotions
	- Channels influencing connecting channels (like divergent) also treat emotions

| Channel | Excess |  Deficiency |
| Lung | Heat in wrist/palm | Yawning, frequent urination |
| Heart | Fullness/pressure in chest/diaphragm | Loss of speech |
| Pericardium | Heart painVexation in Heart |
| Large Intestine | Toothache, deafness | Teeth sensitive to cold, bi conditions |
| Small Intestine | Joint loosening, lack of muscle tone at elbow | Small swelling |
| San Jiao | Elbow muscle spasms/cramps | Lack of elbow muscle tone |
| Stomach | Counterflow qi, throat bi, sudden voice loss | Foot/shin lack of tone/withering |
| Bladder | Nasal congestion with clear discharge, headache, back pain | Clear nasal discharge, nosebleed |
| Gallbladder | Inversion | Lower limb weakness, can't stand from sitting |
| Spleen | Cholera, intestinal stabbing pain | Drum-like abdominal distension | 
| Kidney | Vexation/oppression, constipation, urinary block | Lower back pain |
| Liver | Testicular swelling, abnormal erection | Sudden genital itching |
| Ren | Abdominal skin pain | Abdominal skin itching |
| Du | Back rigidity | Head heaviness, head shaking |
| Great Luo of Spleen | Whole body aching/pain | Looseness of hundred joints |

## TRANSVERSE CONNECTING CHANNELS
- Treat source point of one channel + luo point of its Yin-Yang pair
- Example
	- LU-9 (source) + LI-6 (luo)
	- ST-42 (source) + SP-4 (luo)

### How Divergent Channels Support Primary & Connecting Channels

1. Organ Conditions
- Primary channels connect to organs
- Divergent channels also connect to organs
- Treating divergent channels supports organ treatment
2. Channel Conditions
- Primary channel imbalances
- Divergent channels can assist clearing/reinforcing
3. Emotional Conditions
- Connecting channels hold emotions in blood
- Divergent channels can help release emotions
- Combined treatment creates powerful effect
4. Yin-Yang Synergy
- Classical principle
	- Combining two or more channels creates stronger reaction than treating one channel
	- Divergent channels + primary channels = enhanced treatment

### CLINICAL EXAMPLE: Combining Channels
- Condition
	- Chronic Liver fire with repressed anger
- Treatment Strategy
	- Connecting channel treatment
		- Plum blossom LV-5 and GB-37 (luo points) 
			- releases emotions from blood
	- Divergent channel treatment
		- LV/GB divergent channels 
			- brings emotional energy to surface
	- Primary channel treatment
		- LV-3 (source point) 
			- regulates Liver qi
- Result
	- Divergent channels guide the energy upward/outward, connecting channels provide outlet, primary channels regulate organ - synergistic healing

### Diagnosis Determines Treatment
- Know which channels are affected
	- Location of pain/symptoms
	- Time of occurrence
	- Emotional component
	- Organ involvement

### Never Treat in Isolation
- Modern practice often uses only primary channels. Classical practice:
	- Identifies ALL affected channels
	- Treats multiple systems synergistically
	- Creates comprehensive healing response

### Nourishing QI Cycle (Daily Meridian Clock)
- Cycle Flows like 3-5 AM Lungs -> Liver (1-3 AM)

# Muscle Channels and 12 Months

| Month | Muscle Channel | Susceptibility |
| January | Gallbladder | More vulnerable | this month |
| February | Bladder | More vulnerable | this month |
| March | Stomach | More vulnerable | this month |
| April | Large Intestine | More vulnerable | this month |
| May | Small Intestine | More vulnerable | this month |
| June | San Jiao | More vulnerable | this month |
| July | Kidney | More vulnerable | this month |
| August | Spleen | More vulnerable | this month |
| September | Liver | More vulnerable | this month |
| October | Pericardium | More vulnerable | this month |
| November | Lung | More vulnerable | this month |
| December | Heart | More vulnerable | this month |

## Diagnostic Tool
Diagnostic Tool:
- Condition appears/worsens during specific month?
- Check that month's channel/organ

## Preventive Treatment
- Treat channel during its month
- Strengthen before vulnerability period
- Example
	- Patient with chronic anger issues → most severe in September → Liver is September channel → confirms Liver diagnosis

## Two Functions of Divergent Channel
1. Release pathogens FROM muscle channels
- Heat, cold, wind, damp lodged in muscles
- Divergent channels move them outward
- Combined with muscle channel treatment

2. Release pathogens IN divergent channels
- That transferred from muscle channels
- Move outward to exterior
- Release from body

3. Treatment Strategy
- Divergent channel treatment (move pathogen outward)
- Muscle channel treatment (release from body)
	- Add modality: gua sha, cupping, plum blossom

## Hour of Birth Method
- 
### Hour Branch and Stem Table
| Time            | Organ / Channel       | Source Point |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 11 pm – 1 am    | Gallbladder           | GB-40        |
| 1 am – 3 am     | Liver                 | LV-3         |
| 3 am – 5 am     | Lung                  | LU-9         |
| 5 am – 7 am     | Large Intestine       | LI-4         |
| 7 am – 9 am     | Stomach               | ST-42        |
| 9 am – 11 am    | Spleen                | SP-3         |
| 11 am – 1 pm    | Heart                 | HT-7         |
| 1 pm – 3 pm     | Small Intestine       | SI-4         |
| 3 pm – 5 pm     | Bladder               | BL-64        |
| 5 pm – 7 pm     | Kidney                | KD-3         |
| 7 pm – 9 pm     | Pericardium           | PC-7         |
| 9 pm – 11 pm    | San Jiao              | SJ-4         |

- Clinical Application
	- Diagnosis
		- Person born 5-7 pm → Kidney time
		- Susceptible to Kidney conditions throughout life

## Diagnostic Quests for Chronic Conditions
- What time do symptoms occur? (meridian clock)
- What time after waking? (wei qi cycle)
- What month worse? (muscle channel cycle)
- What hour of birth? (constitutional)

# Five Shen Model

| Organ    | Shen | Element | Virtue                         | Emotion (Imbalanced)                                   | Storehouse of | Shelters |
|----------|------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Heart    | Shen | Fire    | Joy, Love                      | Hastiness, Impatience, Hatred, Arrogance, Cruelty      | channels | shen (Spirit) |
| Spleen  | Yi   | Earth   | Openness                      | Worry, Pensiveness, Obsessiveness, Jealousy            | Nourishment | Yi (thoght) |

### Two-Way Relationship
- Organ → Shen
	- Organ condition influences shen (psychology/spirit)
	- Example: Chronic Kidney deficiency → fear manifests
- Shen → Organ
	- Psychological state influences organ
	- Example: Constant stress → Liver stagnation → anger/irritability
- This is the body-mind unity in Chinese medicine.

	- For both practitioner and patient
- The Goal
	- Attune to Heart shen
	- Direct experience of spirit
	- Realize unity of life (Wu Wei)
	- Live from this awareness

## 2. THE ZHI (志 - Kidney Will)
#### Location & Function
- Kidneys house the zhi:
	- Corresponds to jing (essence)
	- Genetics and ancestral influences
	- Pre-natal essence
	- Willpower
#### Ancestral Influences
- Two Types:
	1. Genetic (Biological):
		- DNA from parents/ancestors
		- Physical constitution
		- Inherited tendencies
	2. Cultural/Environmental (Post-Natal Early Life):
		- Culture, religion, beliefs of family
		- Caretaker influences
		- Early life conditioning
		- Both shape the zhi and must be transcended for fulfillment.
#### The Nature of Zhi
- Willpower:
	- Will and power to follow destiny
	- Ability to fulfill life purpose
- Kidneys loathe cold:
	- Cold freezes water
	- Changes essential nature
	- Blocks adaptability
- Freezing/Rigidity from:
	- Ancestral influences (genetic)
	- Early life conditioning
	- Blocks expression of destiny
	- Prevents flowing, adaptive nature
#### The Kidney-Heart Connection
- Kidney channel flows:
	- Up anterior body to chest
	- Creates front shu points (12 shu points of chest, Su Wen Chapter 58)
	- Zhi seeking Shen
	- Built-in energetic system
- If zhi is frozen:
	- Can't fulfill destiny
	- Can't reach Heart shen
	- Rigidity blocks natural flow
#### Water & Unlimited Potential
- Zhi and jing represent:
	- Chaos/Wu Ji - state where anything is possible
	- Field of spontaneity
	- No limits
	- Unlimited possibilities
	- Blueprint of life/destiny code
When expressed fully:
	- Zhi unfolds naturally
	- Destiny is fulfilled
	- Living from essential nature
When frozen/blocked:
	- Ancestral/family influences create rigidity
	- Inability to be open to all possibilities
	- Kidneys and zhi unfavorably affected
### The Destiny Code
- Zhi contains:
	- Blueprint of life
	- Destiny code
	- Pre-natal potential
- Allowing zhi to unfold = fulfilling destiny
- Internal alchemy (nei dan):
	- Accelerates personal development
	- Allows immersion and expression
	- Accelerates unfolding process
	- Burns karma (cause and effect)
#### Physical Manifestations
- Kidneys open to the ears:
	- Hearing conditions (physical)
	- Not hearing/understanding what others say (perceptual)
	- Communication disconnection

## 3. THE HUN (魂 - Liver Ethereal Soul)
#### Location & Function
	- Liver houses the hun:
		- Ethereal soul
		- Collective consciousness
		- "We" aspect of awareness
		- Community and unity
#### The Collective Nature
- Balanced Hun Expression:
	- Working with others for community benefit
	- Concern for collective/society
	- Unity consciousness
	- Putting oneself in situations benefiting others
- Why Important:
	- Allows awareness of interconnection
	- Opportunity to learn and grow
	- Expression of hun temperament
	- Imbalanced Expressions
- If hun blocked:
	- Acts contrary to temperament
	- Selfish behavior (opposite of unity/community)
	- Blocked expression creates stagnation
- If hun excessive:
	- Too attached to collective (at cost of self-care)
	- Neglects own health and well-being
	- Rising/flying away (escape from body/life)
	- Rejecting personal life
	- Balance is key!
#### Planning & Future Orientation
- Hun relates to:
	- Planning
	- Thinking of future
	- How to achieve goals
	- Vision and direction
- Imbalanced:
	- Excessive planning/worry about future

	- Loss of present moment awareness
#### Physical Manifestations
- Liver opens to the eyes:
	- Vision problems (physical)
	- Lack of perceiving (perceptual)
	- Lack of insight or inner seeing
	- Not just eyesight—perception itself
#### Treatment Implications
- When hun imbalanced:
	- Treatment plan to unblock stagnations
	- Allow natural expression of constitutional temperament
	- Release from body and channels (divergent channels useful)
	- Restore balance between self and collective

## 4. THE PO (魄 - Lung Corporeal Soul)
#### Location & Function
- Lungs house the po:
	- Corporeal soul
	- Relates to physical body
	- Senses, desires, emotions
	- "Me" aspect of self
#### The Physical Attachment
- Po corresponds to:
	- Senses (seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling)
	- Desires (physical pleasures)
	- Emotions (felt in body)
	- Physical body itself
- Imbalanced:
	- Over-attachment to physical/sensory
	- Selfishness ("me, me, me")
	- Greediness
	- Focus on physical/self-pleasure
#### The Channel of Polarity
- Large Intestine channel:
	- Only primary channel crossing body midline
	- "Channel of polarity"
- Polarized Po creates:
	- Separation from others
	- Separation from society
	- Separation from creator/life itself
	- Isolation and loneliness
#### The Loneliness Paradox
- Process:
	- Po polarizes itself
	- Creates separation
	- Intensified loneliness results
	- Loneliness creates response
	- Seeking another way to live
	- Body's innate intelligence seeks homeostasis
- This can initiate change and transformation!
#### Breathing & Present Moment
- Lungs connected to nose:
	- Breathing is key to bringing po to present moment
	- Frees from polarity
	- No polarity exists in current moment
	- Polarity only in thoughts of past/future
- Practices:
	- Breathing exercises
	- Qi Gong
	- Tai Chi Chuan
	- Regulate breath
	- Calm po
	- Promote balance
#### Balanced Po Expression
- Healthy po:
	- Enjoying physical body
	- Appreciating sensory experiences
	- Self-care (not selfishness)
	- Being present in body
- Imbalanced:
	- Selfish, greedy
	- Neglecting/ignoring body
	- Polarization
	- Separation
#### Treatment Strategy
- For po imbalance:
	- Connecting channel treatment (release emotions)
	- Divergent channel treatment (Lung/Large Intestine)
	- Breathwork
	- Bring awareness to present moment

## 5. THE YI (意 - Spleen Intellect)
#### Location & Function
- Spleen houses the yi:
	- Intellect
	- Thoughts, concepts, ideas
	- Logic and reasoning
	- Mental processing
#### The Transformation Function
- Earth element = Spleen/Stomach:
	- Grounding
	- Organizing
	- Digestion

#### Two Types of Digestion:
1. Physical Transformation:
- Food/drink enters mouth (Spleen/Stomach)
- Processed and transformed
- Becomes nutritive substances
- Quality determined by organ condition
2. Psycho-Emotional Transformation:
- Life experiences enter yi
- Yi processes experiences
- Organizes, categorizes, filters
- Makes sense of life
- Quality determined by yi condition
- "Yi processes our life experiences."
#### The Holding Function
- Spleen holds blood in vessels.
	- Yi holds emotions/thoughts in blood.
- How:
	- Feelings arise (spontaneous, Yang, superficial wei energy)
	- Natural cycle: appear and leave (like sun/moon waxing/waning)
	- Imbalanced yi tries to hold feelings artificially
	- Continual thinking keeps experiences alive
	- Feelings transform to emotions (stored in blood/Yin)
	- Becomes conditioning
	- Eventually becomes constitution
	- Prevents spontaneous living
- What we hold is NOT the real experience—it's a thought/memory.
#### The Influence on Other Shen
- Yi processes life experiences:
	- Influences how we perceive
	- Affects hun, po, zhi, and shen
	- Our thinking/opinions about people and life
- If yi imbalanced:
	- All five shen affected
	- Rigid and narrow responses
	- Conditioned reactions (based on past)
	- Past understanding rooted in fear, anger, misunderstanding, prejudice
- Yi susceptible to:
	- Fixed patterns
	- Rigid reactions
	- Repetitive responses
	- Living in past
#### Grounding & Decision-Making
- Yi includes Stomach/Spleen qualities:
	- Being grounded in choices/actions
	- Comfortable with decisions
	- Creating stable attitudes
- When stagnated:
	- Prevents new viewpoints
	- Can't let go of past
	- Can't experience spontaneously
	- Dampness and phlegm manifest
- Damp/Phlegm:
	- Physical manifestation of rigid concepts/thoughts
	- Blockages creating rigidity
	- Slowing down life force
	- Stagnating awareness
#### Physical Manifestations
- Spleen opens to the mouth:
	- Yi imbalances manifest in eating disorders
	- Mouth/eating expression of Spleen/Stomach/yi imbalance
#### Mindfulness & Attention
- Yi includes mindfulness:
	- What we place attention on
	- What we retain in mind
	- Where focus goes
- Overwhelm in childhood:
	- Yi goes into survival mode
	- Creates behavioral patterns to survive
	- Patterns become constitution
	- Reactive ways of responding
- These imprints need understanding:
	- Release from their influence
	- Allow openness to spontaneity
	- Live in present (not what it "should be")
	- Live from shen

### The Fundamental Principle
- Five shen = Five aspects of ONE shen (person)
- Each contains unique aspects, and each shapes the others for wholeness

### Five-Phase Relationships
- Controlling/Shaping Cycle:
	- When balanced:
		- harmonizing force
	- When imbalanced: 
		- overacting/destructive

### Organs/Shen contain innate intelligence
- Messages sent to related shen
- Integral aspect of functioning
- Five-phase cycles show patterns

### The Relationship between 5 Shen
### Heart Shen → Lung Po:
- Message from Shen:
	- "We are essentially spirit."
- Guides Po:
	- In expression of physical life
	- Po close to physical body/aspect
	- When imbalanced: susceptible to polarization → selfishness
	- Unhealthy pursuit of own needs/desires/pleasures
	- Ignoring others' needs
- Balance:
	- Shen expresses yuan shen (original nature) to po
	- Po guided by Heart shen
	- Smooth expression of po in life
	- Natural, spontaneous expression of spirit
- Result when balanced:
	- Living in Tao
	- Living in spirit
	- Christ consciousness / Krishna consciousness / Buddha nature

### Lung Po → Liver Hun:
- Message from Po:
	- "Importance of living in this world, enjoying it, full expression in here and now."
- To Hun (ethereal spirit/collective):
- Imbalanced Hun:
	- Denial of physical body
	- Spiritual pursuit denying physicality
	- Deep polarization
	- Too involved in society/helping others (detriment to own health)
	- Belief it's greater value to help others
	- Rejection of physical needs/desires
- Balance needed:
	- Self AND others
	- Individual AND society
	- Physical AND spiritual
	- Po-hun harmony

### Liver Hun → Spleen Yi:
- Message from Hun:
	- "We are part of the whole, not separate from whole of life."
- To Yi (intellect/concepts):
- Imbalanced Yi:
	- Too attached to thoughts/concepts
	- Attention turns from real life
	- Creates schism (body knows one reality: present)
	- Obsessive/repetitive actions
	- Rooted in extreme/distorted understanding
- Hun helps balance Yi:
	- Receive and process life clearly
	- Spontaneous way (not conditioned/repetitive)
	- Yi is one aspect, not primary aspect

### Spleen Yi → Kidney Zhi:
- Message from Yi:
	- Provides direction/focus
- Applies intention on achieving/accomplishing
- To Zhi (unlimited nature/chaos/primordial):
- Before Yi influence:
	- Zhi = anything is possible
	- Before thinking
	- Before dualistic categorization
	- Chaos (Taoist philosophy)
- Imbalanced Yi overacts:
	- Forces zhi into specific shape
	- Prevents free-flowing nature
	- Creates conditioning in responses
	- Rigidity
- Balanced Yi shapes Zhi:
	- Accomplish goals/objectives
	- Willpower to live desired life
	- Will to seek true nature and live from it
	- Zhi needs some direction (or spreads too much)
### The Relationship Between Yi and Zhi (Channel Examples)
- Chong channel:
	- Begins at ST-30 (chong qi)
	- Stomach = earth
	- Illustrates earth shaping form of jing as it unfolds
- Spleen 4 (gongsun):
	- Opening point of chong channel
	- Earth shaping water
	- Post-natal shaping pre-natal
- Balanced Yi provides:
	- Favorable focus and intention
	- Allows zhi to unfold healthily
	- Openness to receive/experience life
	- Flexibility and adaptability for zhi
	- Natural unfolding
	- Fulfillment of destiny

### Kidney Zhi → Heart Shen:
- Classic Chinese model:
	- Yin-Yang
	- Water-Fire
	- Shao Yin
	- Jing-Shen
- Zhi's capacity:
	- Become anything
	- Clear direction within possibilities
	- Jing seeking shen
	- Zhi seeking Heart shen
- Kidney channel pathway:
	- External pathway flows past Heart area
	- Contains front shu points (5 points)
	- Profound influence on five shen (Su Wen Chapter 58)
- Heart Shen as Goal
	- Heart shen contains:
		- True nature
		- Original spirit (yuan shen)
	- Realization of this:
		- Primary goal/purpose of life (in some traditions)
		- Provides opportunity to live from this awareness
		- Unity of life experienced directly
- Jing seeking shen:
	- Our quest in life
	- Inner energetic system reflecting quest
	- Kidney-Heart trajectory connection
- Divergent channels:
	- Clear away "rough" preventing realization
	- Guide awareness to spirit
	- Support spiritual realization

### CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF FIVE SHEN
#### Diagnosis
- When patient presents with emotions
1. Match emotion to organ/shen:
- Anger → Liver/hun
- Fear → Kidney/zhi
- Worry → Spleen/yi
- Sadness → Lung/po
- Impatience → Heart/shen
2. Assess which shen is imbalanced
3. Determine if organ condition affecting shen OR shen affecting organ

#### Treatment Strategy
- Foundation:
	- Acupuncture channels extend from organs
	- Channel conditions influence organs
	- Organ conditions influence shen
- Connecting channels:
	- Treat blood (emotions stored in blood)
	- Release emotional energy
- Divergent channels:
	- Support connecting channels
	- Support primary channels
	- Assist in releasing emotions from deep levels
- The Process:
	- Identify imbalanced shen/emotion
	- Select appropriate channel system(s)
	- Treat to release or transform
	- Support with cultivation (nei dan, Qi Gong)
- Diamond in the Rough Application
- The Rough:
	- Imbalanced emotions
	- Conditioning
	- Stress
	- Imprints
- The Diamond:
	- Yuan shen (original spirit)
	- True nature
- Treatment Goal:
	- Clear the rough
	- Reveal the diamond
	- Acupuncture and nei dan assist this process
- Progression:
	- Skin level (cutaneous)
	- Micro luo channels
	- Regular luo (connecting) channels
	- Main (primary) channels
	- Internal organs

- The Layers:
	- Hair level
	- Skin level
	- Muscle level
	- Channel level
	- Tendon level
	- Bone and marrow level

- Critical Principle: Treat at the correct depth! Needling too deeply can:
	- Miss the pathogen
	- Push pathogen deeper
	- Damage deeper layers

### THE THREE-LAYER MODEL
- Organizing the Channel System
	- Superficial (Wei) Layer:
		- Cutaneous regions
		- Muscle (sinew/tendon) channels
		- Luo (connecting) channels
		- Defensive qi (wei qi)
	- Middle (Ying) Layer:
		- Primary (major) channels
		- Nutritive qi (ying qi)
		- Internal organs (connection through primary channels)
	- Deep (Yuan) Layer:
		- Eight extraordinary channels
		- Bone and marrow
		- Jing (essence)
		- Source qi (yuan qi)

- Divergent Channels' Unique Position
- Divergent channels influence ALL THREE layers:
	- Wei (superficial): Connect to muscle and luo channels
	- Ying (middle): Arise from primary channels, connect to organs
	- Yuan (deep): Connect to eight extraordinary channels through bones/jing

#### This is why they can treat "an extraordinary number of diseases."

### MODERN CLINICAL APPLICATION
#### The Reality of Modern Practice
- Traditional: 9 different needles with specific functions
- Modern: Primarily use #6 (roundsharp/filiform) for everything
- Problem:
	- One tool cannot optimally treat all layers
	- Missing specificity of classical approach
- Solution:
	- Use needling techniques to mimic effects of different needles
	- Apply appropriate manipulation for each layer/condition

#### NEEDLING TECHNIQUE AS SUBSTITUTE
- Key Insight:
	- Even with one needle type, you can create different effects through:
		1. Insertion Depth
			- Superficial → wei layer
			- Middle → ying layer
			- Deep → yuan layer
		2. Manipulation Method
			- Quick/slow insertion
			- Rotation
			- Lifting/thrusting
			- Scraping
			- Shaking
			- Retention time
		3. Angle of Insertion
			- Perpendicular (deep organs)
			- Oblique (middle layer)
			- Horizontal (superficial/threading)
		4. Number of Needles
			- Single point (precise)
			- Multiple (broad area)
			- Patterns (surround or thread)
		5. Stimulation Intensity
			- Light (tonify)
			- Heavy (reduce)
			- Medium (regulate)
### DIVERGENT CHANNELS AND THE NINE NEEDLES
- Which Needles for Divergent Channels?
	- From the tables:
	- #8 Long needle - deep divergent channel work
	- #9 Large needle - divergent and extraordinary channels
- Why These Needles?
	- Divergent channels:
		- Flow from superficial (wei) to deep (yuan)
		- Need needle long enough to access deep levels
		- Need to influence bones/joints (where they begin/end)
		- Treat both surface and depth simultaneously
#### Modern Application Without Long/Large Needles:
- Instead, use:
	- Multiple points along pathway - stimulates entire channel
	- Appropriate depth at each point - matches local layer
	- Strong manipulation - creates deep effect even with shorter needle
	- Reinforce/reduce techniques - directs qi movement
	- Combined modalities - moxibustion, gua sha, cupping
#### INTEGRATION WITH DIVERGENT CHANNEL TREATMENT
- Treatment Strategy Using Nine Needle Concepts
	- Example: Back Pain from Wind-Damp-Cold (Chapter 10 Case Study)
		- Condition Location:
		- Muscle channels (superficial)
		- Divergent channels (middle)
		- Bones/joints (deep)
	- Classical Approach (if had all 9 needles):
		- Needle #2 (Round) - separate muscles, release wind
		- Needle #8 (Long) - deep divergent channel/bone level
		- Needle #6 (Roundsharp) - primary channel support
- Modern Approach (with filiform only):
	- Superficial needling with manipulation - muscle channels
	- Medium depth - divergent channel pathway points
	- Deep insertion at joint areas - bone level
	- Add moxibustion - warm and expel cold
	- Add gua sha - release wind to exterior

### THE FRAMEWORK FOR PATHOLOGY
#### Nine Needles Provide Diagnostic Framework
- When patient presents, ask:
	- Which layer is affected?
		- Superficial → skin, muscles
		- Middle → primary channels, organs
		- Deep → bones, jing, constitution
- Which channel system?
	- Cutaneous → needle #7
	- Muscle → needles #1, #2
	- Luo → needle #4
	- Primary → needle #6
	- Dive- rgent → needles #8, #9
	- Extraordinary → needles #8, #9
- What type of pathology?
	- Exterior wind → needles #1, #2
	- Blood stasis → needle #4
	- Heat/abscess → needle #5
	- Deep cold → needle #8
	- Joint issues → needle #9
- What technique needed?
	- Arousing → needle #3
	- Releasing → needle #4
	- Warming → needle #8
	- Opening → needle #9
- This framework guides:
	- Diagnosis
	- Channel selection
	- Point selection
	- Needling technique
- Treatment strategy
#### PRACTICAL CLINICAL GUIDANCE
- When Treating Divergent Channels:
	1. Select Multiple Points
	- Confluent points (upper and lower)
	- Pathway points (5-8 points)
	- Root/end points (extremities)
	2. Vary Depth According to Location
	- Superficial at muscle areas
	- Medium at organ areas
	- Deep at bone/joint areas
	3. Apply Clear Technique
	- Reinforce: slow insertion, quick withdrawal, cover hole
	- Reduce: quick insertion, slow withdrawal, leave hole open
	- Guide direction with manipulation
	4. Support with Modalities
	- Moxibustion (warm, tonify)
	- Gua sha (release exterior)
	- Cupping (draw out)
	- Plum blossom (create outlet)
	5. Treat Entire Channel
	- Don't just needle one or two points
	- Stimulate whole pathway
	- Create comprehensive effect

### 14 Foundation Principles
These principles determine when divergent channels are appropriate:
1. Three layers of the body
2. From beginning to end
3. The major channels
4. Yin-Yang paired channels and transporting points
5. Entering and exiting
6. Roots and ends
7. Fifty cycles
8. Anatomical structures and divergent channels
9. Distal needling
10. Emotions and divergent channels
11. Rivers and channels
12. The muscle channels
13. Measurements in reference to the bones
14. Needling technique methods

#### PRINCIPLE 1: THREE LAYERS OF THE BODY
- The Three Layers
	- Wei Layer (Superficial/Defensive):
		- Cutaneous regions
		- Muscle (sinew) channels
		- Connecting (luo) channels
		- Wei qi (defensive qi)
		- Function: Protection from exterior pathogens
	- Ying Layer (Middle/Nutritive):
		- Primary (major) channels
		- Internal organs
		- Ying qi (nutritive qi)
		- Function: Nourishment and organ function
	- Yuan Layer (Deep/Source):
		- Eight extraordinary channels
		- Bone and marrow
		- Jing (essence)
		- Yuan qi (source qi)
		- Function: Constitutional foundation
- Divergent Channels' Unique Capacity
	- They influence ALL THREE layers:
| Layer | Divergent Channel Connection | Treatment Capacity |
| Wei | Connect to muscle and luo channel | sCan release exterior pathogens |
| Ying | Arise from primary channels, connect to organs | Can treat organs and channels | 
| Yuan | Connect to bones, jing, extraordinary channels | Can transform constitution |

- Clinical Significance:
	- This is what makes divergent channels unique and powerful:
		- Only channel system affecting all three layers simultaneously
		- Can move substances/pathogens between layers
		- Can support treatment at any depth
- Targeting the Specific Layer
	- Diagnosis requires determining:
		- Where is the condition located? (which layer)
		- What vital substances are affected?
		- What channel system is involved?
- Treatment Strategy:
	- Superficial conditions (wei layer):
		- Shallow needling
		- Release to exterior
		- Support with gua sha, cupping
	- Middle conditions (ying layer):
		- Medium depth needling
		- Regulate organs and channels
		- Support with herbs, diet
	- Deep conditions (yuan layer):
		- Deep needling
		- Transform constitution
		- Long-term treatment with cultivation
- Divergent channels can:
	- Guide from deep to superficial (release)
	- Guide from superficial to deep (reinforce)
	- Clear all three layers simultaneously

#### PRINCIPLE 2: FROM BEGINNING TO END
- Two important acupuncture theories:
1. The Three Depths of Acupuncture
	- first depth is a shallow insertion (wei level)
	- second depth is a middle insertion (ying level)
	- third depth is deep insertion (yuan level)

- Clinical Application
| Layer | Depth | Influences | 
| Wei | Shallow | Sinew, luo, divergent channels (superficial aspect) |
| Ying | Middle | Primary channels, organs |
| Yuan | Deep | Extraordinary, divergent channels (deep aspect), jing |

#### Key: Must needle at proper depth to influence intended layer!

- 2. Contra-Lateral Needling Principle
- If the condition is located at the upper body, treat the lower body.
- If the condition is at the lower body, treat the upper body.
- If the condition is at the head, treat the foot.
- If the condition is at the loins, treat the crease of the knee.

- Two Principles Behind This:
1. Opposite Side Treatment:
	- One side of body can treat opposite side
	- Left-right correspondence
2. Following Pathogen Movement:
	- Condition can begin in one location
	- Move to another location
	- Treating origin more effective than treating current location
- Clinical Application with Divergent Channels
	- Strategy:
		- Diagnose origin of condition
		- Determine if pathogen has moved
		- Use divergent channels at origin point
		- Create contra-lateral treatment
- Example:
	- Shoulder pain on right
	- Originated in right hip (patient history)
	- Treat hip area with divergent channels
	- Include left hip (contra-lateral)
	- Support with right shoulder local points
- This provides:
	- Treatment at root cause
	- Bilateral balance
	- More effective pathogen release

### PRINCIPLE 3: THE MAJOR (PRIMARY) CHANNELS)
- Pathways (not acupuncture point lists)
- Excess and deficiency conditions
- Includes connecting (luo) channels
- Key Insight: Pathogen Transfer
	- Channel system is interwoven:
		- Pathogenic factors can move within three layers
		- Can transfer between channel systems
		- Primary channels in middle position
		- Can influence deeper and superficial levels
- How Divergent Channels Support Primary Channels
- Primary channels connect to:
	- Internal organs
	- Middle (ying) layer
- Divergent channels also connect to:
	- Same organs
	- But ALSO superficial and deep layers
- Therefore:
- When treating primary channel:
	- Divergent channels can support
	- Act as bridge to other layers
	- Enhance treatment effectiveness
- When treating organs:
	- Primary channels provide direct access
	- Divergent channels mobilize additional resources
	- Create comprehensive healing response
- Integration Strategy
- For Primary Channel Imbalances:
	- Option 1 - Primary Channel Only:
		- Select primary channel points
		- Standard treatment
	- Option 2 - Primary + Divergent:
		- Begin with divergent channel treatment
		- Mobilizes body's resources
		- Then treat primary channel
		- Creates synergy
- Example (Stomach Excess):
- Primary only:
	- Reduce ST-36, ST-44, ST-45
- Primary + Divergent:
	- Treat ST/SP divergent channels (reduce)
	- Then reduce ST-36, ST-44, ST-45
	- Creates stronger downward/outward movement

### PRINCIPLE 4: YIN-YANG PAIRED CHANNELS AND TRANSPORTING POINTS
- Transporting points (well, spring, stream, river, sea)
- Yin-Yang coupled pairs

- The Transporting Points
- Five categories per channel:
| Point Type | Element | Flow Quality | Function |
| Well (井 Jing) | Wood/Metal | Where qi springs forth | Beginning | 
| Spring (滎 Ying) | Fire | Where qi gushes out | Gliding | 
| Stream (輸 Shu) | EarthW | here qi pours | Transporting | 
| River (經 Jing) | Metal/Wood | Where qi flows profusely | Moving | 
| Sea (合 He) | Water | Where qi enters deeply | Converging |

- Important Note:
	- In Ling Shu, these are NOT five-phase points yet!
		- That came later in Nan Ching
		- Example: LU-9 is stream and source point (not "earth point")
- Ling Shu Use:
	- Transporting points treat ANY channel/organ condition
	- Most powerful point category
	- Can supplement divergent channel treatments
- Yin-Yang Paired Channels
- The Pairs:
	- Lung - Large Intestine (metal)
	- Stomach - Spleen (earth)
	- Heart - Small Intestine (fire)
	- Bladder - Kidney (water)
	- Pericardium - San Jiao (fire)
	- Gallbladder - Liver (wood)
- Why They're Connected:
	- Share same element
	- Linked through internal pathways
	- Influence each other
	- Pathogens can transfer between them
- Clinical Principle:
	- "They can be viewed as one interconnected channel, and they can treat each other."
- Application to Divergent Channels
	- Each treatment includes using Yin-Yang primary channel pairs.
	- Same strategy applies to divergent channels:
	- When treating divergent channels:
		- Always use the Yin-Yang paired channels
		- Example: Stomach excess → treat ST and SP divergent channels
		- Creates synergy
- Why This Works:
1. Natural Body Pairing:
	- Interior-exterior relationship
	- Yuan qi flows through both
	- Treating one influences other
2. Synergistic Effect:
	- 1 + 1 = 3 (more than sum of parts)
	- Combined channels create stronger reaction
	- Mobilizes more body resources
3. Balance Restoration:
	- Yin and Yang must harmonize
	- Treating both ensures balance
	- Prevents creating new imbalance

- Five-Phase Point Treatment
- Although not in Ling Shu, later tradition developed:
	- Using five-phase relationships through points:
	- Example (Liver Anger with Irritability):
		- Emotion: Anger
		- Organ: Liver
		- Element: Wood
		- Controlling element: Metal
		- Metal point on Liver channel: LV-4 (Zhong Feng, Middle Seal)
- Theory:
	- "Anger can injure the Liver, but sadness can relieve anger. Sadness is the emotion of the Lungs, which is metal. Metal can relieve anger."
- Treatment:
	- Reduce LV-4 (metal point)
	- Brings metal energy to control wood
	- Can reduce anger
- Can combine with divergent channels:
	- LV/GB divergent treatment (mobilize)
	- LV-4 reduction (control)
	- LV-5 plum blossom (release outlet)

### PRINCIPLE 5: ENTERING AND EXITING
- From Ling Shu Chapter 3
	- "The spirit is the primary qi, the guest is the evil qi. Located at the door means the evil qi pursues the primary qi at those locations where the evil and the primary qi comes out and enters. Don't just stare at the disease. Begin by knowing the evil and the primary qi and which channels are diseased. For illness, know the origins. First know which channels are diseased, then treat them at those locations."
- Translation
- "Spirit" (primary qi):
	- Body's righteous qi
	- Healthy vital force
- "Guest" (evil qi):
	- Pathogenic factor
	- External or internal
- "Door":
	- Entry and exit points
	- Where pathogens enter/leave channels

- Three Critical Diagnostic Questions
1. Which channels are diseased?
	- Not just which organs
	- Which channel system(s)
	- Specific pathways affected
2. Where did the pathogen enter?
	- Point of origin
	- Path of progression
3. Where does it need to exit?
	- Natural exit route
	- Treatment outlet

- Clinical Application
- Traditional approach:
	- Focuses on disease presentation
	- Treats where patient feels symptoms
- Ling Shu approach:
	- Identify affected channel(s)
	- Determine entry point
	- Plan exit route
	- Treat along pathway
- Divergent channels excel at:
	- Identifying pathogen location in body
	- Guiding pathogens from deep to superficial
	- Creating exit pathways (upward/outward)
	- Supporting release from body
- Example: Cold Lodged in Spine
	- Symptoms: Back pain, stiffness, cold sensation
	- Channel Diagnosis:
		- Bladder and Kidney divergent channels (flow along spine)
	- Pathogen: wind-damp-cold
	- Location: Middle of spine (T11-L4)
- Entry/Exit Strategy:
	- Entry: Lower back (BL-40 area)
	- Current location: Spine
	- Exit route: Up spine to neck (BL-10), then disperse
	- Additional outlet: Gua sha on spine
- Treatment:
	- Reduce BL/KD divergent channels
	- Create upward/outward movement
	- Gua sha provides exterior outlet
	- Moxibustion warms and expels
