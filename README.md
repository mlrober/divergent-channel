# Different Types of Channels
- Cutaneous Channels (Skin level)
- Muscle (Sinews) Channels
- Connecting (Luo) Channels
- Primary (Superficial) channels
- Divergent (Separate) Channels

# Core Principle
- Pathogens can transfer FROM other channels INTO divergent channels
- Divergent Channels can influence ALL areas they connect to
- The flow goes BOTH WAYS: Imbalances flow in; treatment flows out

# Seven Clinical Applications
- Treat Conditions along divergent pathways
	- Divergent channels reach areas primary channels don'they
		- E.g. Spine or Internal organs directly
- Treat associated internal organs
	- Each Yin or Yang pair connects to related organs
	- Direct organ influence distinguishes them from muscle channels
- Treat primary channel conditions
	- Support Primary Channel treatments
- Treat Connecting (luo) Channel conditions
	- Especially emotional conditions
	- Blood channels hold emotions
- Treat Muscle (Sinew) channel conditions
	- Musculoskeletal issues, bi syndrome
- Treat Bone-level conditions
	- Connect to Eight Extraordinary Vessels
	- Influence Jing (Essence)

 # Layer Integration
- Divergent channels are unique because they influence:
	- Wei layer (superficial: skin, muscles)
	- Ying layer (middle: primary channels, organs)
	- Yuan layer (deep: extraordinary channels, jing)

# 8 Essential Qualities
1. Branch from primary channels
- Diverge at specific points
- Return to rejoin primary channels
2. Flow through major joints
- Joints are large spaces
- Spaces where pathogens can lodge
- Knees, hips, shoulders, elbows
3. Ascending flow
- Begin at knees (Bladder-Kidney)
- Move up to hip → chest → shoulders → throat → face
- Exception: San Jiao descends from head
- This ascending function moves substances and pathogens upward/outward
4. Move bidirectionally
- Outward movement: Releases pathogenic factors
- Inward movement: Reinforces organs, maintains latency
- Can guide body's substances to specific areas
5. Distribute qi to head region
- Neck, face, head, sensory organs
- All six pairs reach the head area
6. Flow superficially AND deeply
- Cover areas primary channels don't reach
- Influence wei (superficial), ying (middle), and yuan (deep) layers
7. Have no points of their own
- Share points with primary channels
- Pathway intersections become treatment points
8. Strengthen Yin-Yang connections
- Unite paired channels
- Can influence internal organs directly

# Roots and Ends
- Different from confluent points! These show where pathogens can enter divergent channels

| Channel | Root (Begin) | End | Anatomical Area |
| Tai Yang | BL-67 | BL-1 | Eyes |
| Shao Yang | GB-44 | SI-19 | Ear |
| Yang Ming | ST-45 | ST-8 | Corner of head |
| Tai Yin | SP-1 | Ren-12 | Stomach |
| Shao Yin | KD-1 | Ren-23 | Throat |
| Jue Yin | LV-1 | Ren-17 | Chest |

## Clinical Application
- Use BOTH confluent points AND root/end points
- Roots begin on extremities (no confluent points there)
- Provides additional treatment entry points

- From Ling Shu:
- For one who comprehends ends and beginnings, one sentence is enough.
- For one who does not understand ends and beginnings, the way of the needle is completely cut off.

# Always treat the entire pathway, not just 1-2 points!
