# Core Principle
- Pathogens can transfer FROM other channels INTO divergent channels
- Divergent Channels can influence ALL areas they connect to
- The flow goes BOTH WAYS: Imbalances flow in; treatment flows out

# Seven Clinical Applications
- Treat Conditions along divergent pathways
	- Divergent channels reach areas primary channels don'they
		- E.g. Spine or Internal organs directly
- Treat associated internal organs
	- Each Yin or Yang pair connects to related organs
	- Direct organ influence distinguishes them from muscle channels
- Treat primary channel conditions
	- Support Primary Channel treatments
- Treat Connecting (luo) Channel conditions
	- Especially emotional conditions
	- Blood channels hold emotions
- Treat Muscle (Sinew) channel conditions
	- Musculoskeletal issues, bi syndrome
- Treat Bone-level conditions
	- Connect to Eight Extraordinary Vessels
	- Influence Jing (Essence)

 # Layer Integration
- Divergent channels are unique because they influence:
	- Wei layer (superficial: skin, muscles)
	- Ying layer (middle: primary channels, organs)
	- Yuan layer (deep: extraordinary channels, jing)

# 8 Essential Qualities
1. Branch from primary channels
- Diverge at specific points
- Return to rejoin primary channels
2. Flow through major joints
- Joints are large spaces
- Spaces where pathogens can lodge
- Knees, hips, shoulders, elbows
3. Ascending flow
- Begin at knees (Bladder-Kidney)
- Move up to hip → chest → shoulders → throat → face
- Exception: San Jiao descends from head
- This ascending function moves substances and pathogens upward/outward
4. Move bidirectionally
- Outward movement: Releases pathogenic factors
- Inward movement: Reinforces organs, maintains latency
- Can guide body's substances to specific areas
5. Distribute qi to head region
- Neck, face, head, sensory organs
- All six pairs reach the head area
6. Flow superficially AND deeply
- Cover areas primary channels don't reach
- Influence wei (superficial), ying (middle), and yuan (deep) layers
7. Have no points of their own
- Share points with primary channels
- Pathway intersections become treatment points
8. Strengthen Yin-Yang connections
- Unite paired channels
- Can influence internal organs directly

# Roots and Ends
- Different from confluent points! These show where pathogens can enter divergent channels

| Channel | Root (Begin) | End | Anatomical Area |
| Tai Yang | BL-67 | BL-1 | Eyes |
| Shao Yang | GB-44 | SI-19 | Ear |
| Yang Ming | ST-45 | ST-8 | Corner of head |
| Tai Yin | SP-1 | Ren-12 | Stomach |
| Shao Yin | KD-1 | Ren-23 | Throat |
| Jue Yin | LV-1 | Ren-17 | Chest |

## Clinical Application
- Use BOTH confluent points AND root/end points
- Roots begin on extremities (no confluent points there)
- Provides additional treatment entry points

- From Ling Shu:
- For one who comprehends ends and beginnings, one sentence is enough.
- For one who does not understand ends and beginnings, the way of the needle is completely cut off.

# Always treat the entire pathway, not just 1-2 points!

## Luo Connecting Channels
- Emotions are stored in the blood, and the connecting channels treat blood.
	- Connecting channels treat emotions
	- Channels influencing connecting channels (like divergent) also treat emotions

| Channel | Excess |  Deficiency |
| Lung | Heat in wrist/palm | Yawning, frequent urination |
| Heart | Fullness/pressure in chest/diaphragm | Loss of speech |
| Pericardium | Heart painVexation in Heart |
| Large Intestine | Toothache, deafness | Teeth sensitive to cold, bi conditions |
| Small Intestine | Joint loosening, lack of muscle tone at elbow | Small swelling |
| San Jiao | Elbow muscle spasms/cramps | Lack of elbow muscle tone |
| Stomach | Counterflow qi, throat bi, sudden voice loss | Foot/shin lack of tone/withering |
| Bladder | Nasal congestion with clear discharge, headache, back pain | Clear nasal discharge, nosebleed |
| Gallbladder | Inversion | Lower limb weakness, can't stand from sitting |
| Spleen | Cholera, intestinal stabbing pain | Drum-like abdominal distension | 
| Kidney | Vexation/oppression, constipation, urinary block | Lower back pain |
| Liver | Testicular swelling, abnormal erection | Sudden genital itching |
| Ren | Abdominal skin pain | Abdominal skin itching |
| Du | Back rigidity | Head heaviness, head shaking |
| Great Luo of Spleen | Whole body aching/pain | Looseness of hundred joints |

## TRANSVERSE CONNECTING CHANNELS
- Treat source point of one channel + luo point of its Yin-Yang pair
- Example
	- LU-9 (source) + LI-6 (luo)
	- ST-42 (source) + SP-4 (luo)

### How Divergent Channels Support Primary & Connecting Channels

1. Organ Conditions
- Primary channels connect to organs
- Divergent channels also connect to organs
- Treating divergent channels supports organ treatment
2. Channel Conditions
- Primary channel imbalances
- Divergent channels can assist clearing/reinforcing
3. Emotional Conditions
- Connecting channels hold emotions in blood
- Divergent channels can help release emotions
- Combined treatment creates powerful effect
4. Yin-Yang Synergy
- Classical principle
	- Combining two or more channels creates stronger reaction than treating one channel
	- Divergent channels + primary channels = enhanced treatment

### CLINICAL EXAMPLE: Combining Channels
- Condition
	- Chronic Liver fire with repressed anger
- Treatment Strategy
	- Connecting channel treatment
		- Plum blossom LV-5 and GB-37 (luo points) 
			- releases emotions from blood
	- Divergent channel treatment
		- LV/GB divergent channels 
			- brings emotional energy to surface
	- Primary channel treatment
		- LV-3 (source point) 
			- regulates Liver qi
- Result
	- Divergent channels guide the energy upward/outward, connecting channels provide outlet, primary channels regulate organ - synergistic healing

### Diagnosis Determines Treatment
- Know which channels are affected
	- Location of pain/symptoms
	- Time of occurrence
	- Emotional component
	- Organ involvement

### Never Treat in Isolation
- Modern practice often uses only primary channels. Classical practice:
	- Identifies ALL affected channels
	- Treats multiple systems synergistically
	- Creates comprehensive healing response

### Nourishing QI Cycle (Daily Meridian Clock)
- Cycle Flows like 3-5 AM Lungs -> Liver (1-3 AM)

# Muscle Channels and 12 Months

| Month | Muscle Channel | Susceptibility |
| January | Gallbladder | More vulnerable | this month |
| February | Bladder | More vulnerable | this month |
| March | Stomach | More vulnerable | this month |
| April | Large Intestine | More vulnerable | this month |
| May | Small Intestine | More vulnerable | this month |
| June | San Jiao | More vulnerable | this month |
| July | Kidney | More vulnerable | this month |
| August | Spleen | More vulnerable | this month |
| September | Liver | More vulnerable | this month |
| October | Pericardium | More vulnerable | this month |
| November | Lung | More vulnerable | this month |
| December | Heart | More vulnerable | this month |

## Diagnostic Tool
Diagnostic Tool:
- Condition appears/worsens during specific month?
- Check that month's channel/organ

## Preventive Treatment
- Treat channel during its month
- Strengthen before vulnerability period
- Example
	- Patient with chronic anger issues → most severe in September → Liver is September channel → confirms Liver diagnosis

## Two Functions of Divergent Channel
1. Release pathogens FROM muscle channels
- Heat, cold, wind, damp lodged in muscles
- Divergent channels move them outward
- Combined with muscle channel treatment

2. Release pathogens IN divergent channels
- That transferred from muscle channels
- Move outward to exterior
- Release from body

3. Treatment Strategy
- Divergent channel treatment (move pathogen outward)
- Muscle channel treatment (release from body)
	- Add modality: gua sha, cupping, plum blossom

## Hour of Birth Method
- 
### Hour Branch and Stem Table
| Time            | Organ / Channel       | Source Point |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 11 pm – 1 am    | Gallbladder           | GB-40        |
| 1 am – 3 am     | Liver                 | LV-3         |
| 3 am – 5 am     | Lung                  | LU-9         |
| 5 am – 7 am     | Large Intestine       | LI-4         |
| 7 am – 9 am     | Stomach               | ST-42        |
| 9 am – 11 am    | Spleen                | SP-3         |
| 11 am – 1 pm    | Heart                 | HT-7         |
| 1 pm – 3 pm     | Small Intestine       | SI-4         |
| 3 pm – 5 pm     | Bladder               | BL-64        |
| 5 pm – 7 pm     | Kidney                | KD-3         |
| 7 pm – 9 pm     | Pericardium           | PC-7         |
| 9 pm – 11 pm    | San Jiao              | SJ-4         |

- Clinical Application
	- Diagnosis
		- Person born 5-7 pm → Kidney time
		- Susceptible to Kidney conditions throughout life

## Diagnostic Quests for Chronic Conditions
- What time do symptoms occur? (meridian clock)
- What time after waking? (wei qi cycle)
- What month worse? (muscle channel cycle)
- What hour of birth? (constitutional)

# Five Shen Model

| Organ    | Shen | Element | Virtue                         | Emotion (Imbalanced)                                   | Storehouse of | Shelters |
|----------|------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Heart    | Shen | Fire    | Joy, Love                      | Hastiness, Impatience, Hatred, Arrogance, Cruelty      | channels | shen (Spirit) |
| Spleen  | Yi   | Earth   | Openness                      | Worry, Pensiveness, Obsessiveness, Jealousy            | Nourishment | Yi (thoght) |

### Two-Way Relationship
- Organ → Shen
	- Organ condition influences shen (psychology/spirit)
	- Example: Chronic Kidney deficiency → fear manifests
- Shen → Organ
	- Psychological state influences organ
	- Example: Constant stress → Liver stagnation → anger/irritability
- This is the body-mind unity in Chinese medicine.

	- For both practitioner and patient
- The Goal
	- Attune to Heart shen
	- Direct experience of spirit
	- Realize unity of life (Wu Wei)
	- Live from this awareness

## 2. THE ZHI (志 - Kidney Will)
#### Location & Function
- Kidneys house the zhi:
	- Corresponds to jing (essence)
	- Genetics and ancestral influences
	- Pre-natal essence
	- Willpower
#### Ancestral Influences
- Two Types:
	1. Genetic (Biological):
		- DNA from parents/ancestors
		- Physical constitution
		- Inherited tendencies
	2. Cultural/Environmental (Post-Natal Early Life):
		- Culture, religion, beliefs of family
		- Caretaker influences
		- Early life conditioning
		- Both shape the zhi and must be transcended for fulfillment.
#### The Nature of Zhi
- Willpower:
	- Will and power to follow destiny
	- Ability to fulfill life purpose
- Kidneys loathe cold:
	- Cold freezes water
	- Changes essential nature
	- Blocks adaptability
- Freezing/Rigidity from:
	- Ancestral influences (genetic)
	- Early life conditioning
	- Blocks expression of destiny
	- Prevents flowing, adaptive nature
#### The Kidney-Heart Connection
- Kidney channel flows:
	- Up anterior body to chest
	- Creates front shu points (12 shu points of chest, Su Wen Chapter 58)
	- Zhi seeking Shen
	- Built-in energetic system
- If zhi is frozen:
	- Can't fulfill destiny
	- Can't reach Heart shen
	- Rigidity blocks natural flow
#### Water & Unlimited Potential
- Zhi and jing represent:
	- Chaos/Wu Ji - state where anything is possible
	- Field of spontaneity
	- No limits
	- Unlimited possibilities
	- Blueprint of life/destiny code
When expressed fully:
	- Zhi unfolds naturally
	- Destiny is fulfilled
	- Living from essential nature
When frozen/blocked:
	- Ancestral/family influences create rigidity
	- Inability to be open to all possibilities
	- Kidneys and zhi unfavorably affected
### The Destiny Code
- Zhi contains:
	- Blueprint of life
	- Destiny code
	- Pre-natal potential
- Allowing zhi to unfold = fulfilling destiny
- Internal alchemy (nei dan):
	- Accelerates personal development
	- Allows immersion and expression
	- Accelerates unfolding process
	- Burns karma (cause and effect)
#### Physical Manifestations
- Kidneys open to the ears:
	- Hearing conditions (physical)
	- Not hearing/understanding what others say (perceptual)
	- Communication disconnection

## 3. THE HUN (魂 - Liver Ethereal Soul)
#### Location & Function
	- Liver houses the hun:
		- Ethereal soul
		- Collective consciousness
		- "We" aspect of awareness
		- Community and unity
#### The Collective Nature
- Balanced Hun Expression:
	- Working with others for community benefit
	- Concern for collective/society
	- Unity consciousness
	- Putting oneself in situations benefiting others
- Why Important:
	- Allows awareness of interconnection
	- Opportunity to learn and grow
	- Expression of hun temperament
	- Imbalanced Expressions
- If hun blocked:
	- Acts contrary to temperament
	- Selfish behavior (opposite of unity/community)
	- Blocked expression creates stagnation
- If hun excessive:
	- Too attached to collective (at cost of self-care)
	- Neglects own health and well-being
	- Rising/flying away (escape from body/life)
	- Rejecting personal life
	- Balance is key!
#### Planning & Future Orientation
- Hun relates to:
	- Planning
	- Thinking of future
	- How to achieve goals
	- Vision and direction
- Imbalanced:
	- Excessive planning/worry about future

	- Loss of present moment awareness
#### Physical Manifestations
- Liver opens to the eyes:
	- Vision problems (physical)
	- Lack of perceiving (perceptual)
	- Lack of insight or inner seeing
	- Not just eyesight—perception itself
#### Treatment Implications
- When hun imbalanced:
	- Treatment plan to unblock stagnations
	- Allow natural expression of constitutional temperament
	- Release from body and channels (divergent channels useful)
	- Restore balance between self and collective

## 4. THE PO (魄 - Lung Corporeal Soul)
#### Location & Function
- Lungs house the po:
	- Corporeal soul
	- Relates to physical body
	- Senses, desires, emotions
	- "Me" aspect of self
#### The Physical Attachment
- Po corresponds to:
	- Senses (seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling)
	- Desires (physical pleasures)
	- Emotions (felt in body)
	- Physical body itself
- Imbalanced:
	- Over-attachment to physical/sensory
	- Selfishness ("me, me, me")
	- Greediness
	- Focus on physical/self-pleasure
#### The Channel of Polarity
- Large Intestine channel:
	- Only primary channel crossing body midline
	- "Channel of polarity"
- Polarized Po creates:
	- Separation from others
	- Separation from society
	- Separation from creator/life itself
	- Isolation and loneliness
#### The Loneliness Paradox
- Process:
	- Po polarizes itself
	- Creates separation
	- Intensified loneliness results
	- Loneliness creates response
	- Seeking another way to live
	- Body's innate intelligence seeks homeostasis
- This can initiate change and transformation!
#### Breathing & Present Moment
- Lungs connected to nose:
	- Breathing is key to bringing po to present moment
	- Frees from polarity
	- No polarity exists in current moment
	- Polarity only in thoughts of past/future
- Practices:
	- Breathing exercises
	- Qi Gong
	- Tai Chi Chuan
	- Regulate breath
	- Calm po
	- Promote balance
#### Balanced Po Expression
- Healthy po:
	- Enjoying physical body
	- Appreciating sensory experiences
	- Self-care (not selfishness)
	- Being present in body
- Imbalanced:
	- Selfish, greedy
	- Neglecting/ignoring body
	- Polarization
	- Separation
#### Treatment Strategy
- For po imbalance:
	- Connecting channel treatment (release emotions)
	- Divergent channel treatment (Lung/Large Intestine)
	- Breathwork
	- Bring awareness to present moment

## 5. THE YI (意 - Spleen Intellect)
#### Location & Function
- Spleen houses the yi:
	- Intellect
	- Thoughts, concepts, ideas
	- Logic and reasoning
	- Mental processing
#### The Transformation Function
- Earth element = Spleen/Stomach:
	- Grounding
	- Organizing
	- Digestion

#### Two Types of Digestion:
1. Physical Transformation:
- Food/drink enters mouth (Spleen/Stomach)
- Processed and transformed
- Becomes nutritive substances
- Quality determined by organ condition
2. Psycho-Emotional Transformation:
- Life experiences enter yi
- Yi processes experiences
- Organizes, categorizes, filters
- Makes sense of life
- Quality determined by yi condition
- "Yi processes our life experiences."
#### The Holding Function
- Spleen holds blood in vessels.
	- Yi holds emotions/thoughts in blood.
- How:
	- Feelings arise (spontaneous, Yang, superficial wei energy)
	- Natural cycle: appear and leave (like sun/moon waxing/waning)
	- Imbalanced yi tries to hold feelings artificially
	- Continual thinking keeps experiences alive
	- Feelings transform to emotions (stored in blood/Yin)
	- Becomes conditioning
	- Eventually becomes constitution
	- Prevents spontaneous living
- What we hold is NOT the real experience—it's a thought/memory.
#### The Influence on Other Shen
- Yi processes life experiences:
	- Influences how we perceive
	- Affects hun, po, zhi, and shen
	- Our thinking/opinions about people and life
- If yi imbalanced:
	- All five shen affected
	- Rigid and narrow responses
	- Conditioned reactions (based on past)
	- Past understanding rooted in fear, anger, misunderstanding, prejudice
- Yi susceptible to:
	- Fixed patterns
	- Rigid reactions
	- Repetitive responses
	- Living in past
#### Grounding & Decision-Making
- Yi includes Stomach/Spleen qualities:
	- Being grounded in choices/actions
	- Comfortable with decisions
	- Creating stable attitudes
- When stagnated:
	- Prevents new viewpoints
	- Can't let go of past
	- Can't experience spontaneously
	- Dampness and phlegm manifest
- Damp/Phlegm:
	- Physical manifestation of rigid concepts/thoughts
	- Blockages creating rigidity
	- Slowing down life force
	- Stagnating awareness
#### Physical Manifestations
- Spleen opens to the mouth:
	- Yi imbalances manifest in eating disorders
	- Mouth/eating expression of Spleen/Stomach/yi imbalance
#### Mindfulness & Attention
- Yi includes mindfulness:
	- What we place attention on
	- What we retain in mind
	- Where focus goes
- Overwhelm in childhood:
	- Yi goes into survival mode
	- Creates behavioral patterns to survive
	- Patterns become constitution
	- Reactive ways of responding
- These imprints need understanding:
	- Release from their influence
	- Allow openness to spontaneity
	- Live in present (not what it "should be")
	- Live from shen

### The Fundamental Principle
- Five shen = Five aspects of ONE shen (person)
- Each contains unique aspects, and each shapes the others for wholeness

### Five-Phase Relationships
- Controlling/Shaping Cycle:
	- When balanced:
		- harmonizing force
	- When imbalanced: 
		- overacting/destructive

### Organs/Shen contain innate intelligence
- Messages sent to related shen
- Integral aspect of functioning
- Five-phase cycles show patterns

### The Relationship between 5 Shen
### Heart Shen → Lung Po:
- Message from Shen:
	- "We are essentially spirit."
- Guides Po:
	- In expression of physical life
	- Po close to physical body/aspect
	- When imbalanced: susceptible to polarization → selfishness
	- Unhealthy pursuit of own needs/desires/pleasures
	- Ignoring others' needs
- Balance:
	- Shen expresses yuan shen (original nature) to po
	- Po guided by Heart shen
	- Smooth expression of po in life
	- Natural, spontaneous expression of spirit
- Result when balanced:
	- Living in Tao
	- Living in spirit
	- Christ consciousness / Krishna consciousness / Buddha nature

### Lung Po → Liver Hun:
- Message from Po:
	- "Importance of living in this world, enjoying it, full expression in here and now."
- To Hun (ethereal spirit/collective):
- Imbalanced Hun:
	- Denial of physical body
	- Spiritual pursuit denying physicality
	- Deep polarization
	- Too involved in society/helping others (detriment to own health)
	- Belief it's greater value to help others
	- Rejection of physical needs/desires
- Balance needed:
	- Self AND others
	- Individual AND society
	- Physical AND spiritual
	- Po-hun harmony

### Liver Hun → Spleen Yi:
- Message from Hun:
	- "We are part of the whole, not separate from whole of life."
- To Yi (intellect/concepts):
- Imbalanced Yi:
	- Too attached to thoughts/concepts
	- Attention turns from real life
	- Creates schism (body knows one reality: present)
	- Obsessive/repetitive actions
	- Rooted in extreme/distorted understanding
- Hun helps balance Yi:
	- Receive and process life clearly
	- Spontaneous way (not conditioned/repetitive)
	- Yi is one aspect, not primary aspect

### Spleen Yi → Kidney Zhi:
- Message from Yi:
	- Provides direction/focus
- Applies intention on achieving/accomplishing
- To Zhi (unlimited nature/chaos/primordial):
- Before Yi influence:
	- Zhi = anything is possible
	- Before thinking
	- Before dualistic categorization
	- Chaos (Taoist philosophy)
- Imbalanced Yi overacts:
	- Forces zhi into specific shape
	- Prevents free-flowing nature
	- Creates conditioning in responses
	- Rigidity
- Balanced Yi shapes Zhi:
	- Accomplish goals/objectives
	- Willpower to live desired life
	- Will to seek true nature and live from it
	- Zhi needs some direction (or spreads too much)
### The Relationship Between Yi and Zhi (Channel Examples)
- Chong channel:
	- Begins at ST-30 (chong qi)
	- Stomach = earth
	- Illustrates earth shaping form of jing as it unfolds
- Spleen 4 (gongsun):
	- Opening point of chong channel
	- Earth shaping water
	- Post-natal shaping pre-natal
- Balanced Yi provides:
	- Favorable focus and intention
	- Allows zhi to unfold healthily
	- Openness to receive/experience life
	- Flexibility and adaptability for zhi
	- Natural unfolding
	- Fulfillment of destiny

### Kidney Zhi → Heart Shen:
- Classic Chinese model:
	- Yin-Yang
	- Water-Fire
	- Shao Yin
	- Jing-Shen
- Zhi's capacity:
	- Become anything
	- Clear direction within possibilities
	- Jing seeking shen
	- Zhi seeking Heart shen
- Kidney channel pathway:
	- External pathway flows past Heart area
	- Contains front shu points (5 points)
	- Profound influence on five shen (Su Wen Chapter 58)
- Heart Shen as Goal
	- Heart shen contains:
		- True nature
		- Original spirit (yuan shen)
	- Realization of this:
		- Primary goal/purpose of life (in some traditions)
		- Provides opportunity to live from this awareness
		- Unity of life experienced directly
- Jing seeking shen:
	- Our quest in life
	- Inner energetic system reflecting quest
	- Kidney-Heart trajectory connection
- Divergent channels:
	- Clear away "rough" preventing realization
	- Guide awareness to spirit
	- Support spiritual realization

### CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF FIVE SHEN
#### Diagnosis
- When patient presents with emotions
1. Match emotion to organ/shen:
- Anger → Liver/hun
- Fear → Kidney/zhi
- Worry → Spleen/yi
- Sadness → Lung/po
- Impatience → Heart/shen
2. Assess which shen is imbalanced
3. Determine if organ condition affecting shen OR shen affecting organ

#### Treatment Strategy
- Foundation:
	- Acupuncture channels extend from organs
	- Channel conditions influence organs
	- Organ conditions influence shen
- Connecting channels:
	- Treat blood (emotions stored in blood)
	- Release emotional energy
- Divergent channels:
	- Support connecting channels
	- Support primary channels
	- Assist in releasing emotions from deep levels
- The Process:
	- Identify imbalanced shen/emotion
	- Select appropriate channel system(s)
	- Treat to release or transform
	- Support with cultivation (nei dan, Qi Gong)
- Diamond in the Rough Application
- The Rough:
	- Imbalanced emotions
	- Conditioning
	- Stress
	- Imprints
- The Diamond:
	- Yuan shen (original spirit)
	- True nature
- Treatment Goal:
	- Clear the rough
	- Reveal the diamond
	- Acupuncture and nei dan assist this process
- Progression:
	- Skin level (cutaneous)
	- Micro luo channels
	- Regular luo (connecting) channels
	- Main (primary) channels
	- Internal organs

- The Layers:
	- Hair level
	- Skin level
	- Muscle level
	- Channel level
	- Tendon level
	- Bone and marrow level

- Critical Principle: Treat at the correct depth! Needling too deeply can:
	- Miss the pathogen
	- Push pathogen deeper
	- Damage deeper layers

### THE THREE-LAYER MODEL
- Organizing the Channel System
	- Superficial (Wei) Layer:
		- Cutaneous regions
		- Muscle (sinew/tendon) channels
		- Luo (connecting) channels
		- Defensive qi (wei qi)
	- Middle (Ying) Layer:
		- Primary (major) channels
		- Nutritive qi (ying qi)
		- Internal organs (connection through primary channels)
	- Deep (Yuan) Layer:
		- Eight extraordinary channels
		- Bone and marrow
		- Jing (essence)
		- Source qi (yuan qi)

- Divergent Channels' Unique Position
- Divergent channels influence ALL THREE layers:
	- Wei (superficial): Connect to muscle and luo channels
	- Ying (middle): Arise from primary channels, connect to organs
	- Yuan (deep): Connect to eight extraordinary channels through bones/jing

#### This is why they can treat "an extraordinary number of diseases."

### MODERN CLINICAL APPLICATION
#### The Reality of Modern Practice
- Traditional: 9 different needles with specific functions
- Modern: Primarily use #6 (roundsharp/filiform) for everything
- Problem:
	- One tool cannot optimally treat all layers
	- Missing specificity of classical approach
- Solution:
	- Use needling techniques to mimic effects of different needles
	- Apply appropriate manipulation for each layer/condition

#### NEEDLING TECHNIQUE AS SUBSTITUTE
- Key Insight:
	- Even with one needle type, you can create different effects through:
		1. Insertion Depth
			- Superficial → wei layer
			- Middle → ying layer
			- Deep → yuan layer
		2. Manipulation Method
			- Quick/slow insertion
			- Rotation
			- Lifting/thrusting
			- Scraping
			- Shaking
			- Retention time
		3. Angle of Insertion
			- Perpendicular (deep organs)
			- Oblique (middle layer)
			- Horizontal (superficial/threading)
		4. Number of Needles
			- Single point (precise)
			- Multiple (broad area)
			- Patterns (surround or thread)
		5. Stimulation Intensity
			- Light (tonify)
			- Heavy (reduce)
			- Medium (regulate)
### DIVERGENT CHANNELS AND THE NINE NEEDLES
- Which Needles for Divergent Channels?
	- From the tables:
	- #8 Long needle - deep divergent channel work
	- #9 Large needle - divergent and extraordinary channels
- Why These Needles?
	- Divergent channels:
		- Flow from superficial (wei) to deep (yuan)
		- Need needle long enough to access deep levels
		- Need to influence bones/joints (where they begin/end)
		- Treat both surface and depth simultaneously
#### Modern Application Without Long/Large Needles:
- Instead, use:
	- Multiple points along pathway - stimulates entire channel
	- Appropriate depth at each point - matches local layer
	- Strong manipulation - creates deep effect even with shorter needle
	- Reinforce/reduce techniques - directs qi movement
	- Combined modalities - moxibustion, gua sha, cupping
#### INTEGRATION WITH DIVERGENT CHANNEL TREATMENT
- Treatment Strategy Using Nine Needle Concepts
	- Example: Back Pain from Wind-Damp-Cold (Chapter 10 Case Study)
		- Condition Location:
		- Muscle channels (superficial)
		- Divergent channels (middle)
		- Bones/joints (deep)
	- Classical Approach (if had all 9 needles):
		- Needle #2 (Round) - separate muscles, release wind
		- Needle #8 (Long) - deep divergent channel/bone level
		- Needle #6 (Roundsharp) - primary channel support
- Modern Approach (with filiform only):
	- Superficial needling with manipulation - muscle channels
	- Medium depth - divergent channel pathway points
	- Deep insertion at joint areas - bone level
	- Add moxibustion - warm and expel cold
	- Add gua sha - release wind to exterior

### THE FRAMEWORK FOR PATHOLOGY
#### Nine Needles Provide Diagnostic Framework
- When patient presents, ask:
	- Which layer is affected?
		- Superficial → skin, muscles
		- Middle → primary channels, organs
		- Deep → bones, jing, constitution
- Which channel system?
	- Cutaneous → needle #7
	- Muscle → needles #1, #2
	- Luo → needle #4
	- Primary → needle #6
	- Dive- rgent → needles #8, #9
	- Extraordinary → needles #8, #9
- What type of pathology?
	- Exterior wind → needles #1, #2
	- Blood stasis → needle #4
	- Heat/abscess → needle #5
	- Deep cold → needle #8
	- Joint issues → needle #9
- What technique needed?
	- Arousing → needle #3
	- Releasing → needle #4
	- Warming → needle #8
	- Opening → needle #9
- This framework guides:
	- Diagnosis
	- Channel selection
	- Point selection
	- Needling technique
- Treatment strategy
#### PRACTICAL CLINICAL GUIDANCE
- When Treating Divergent Channels:
	1. Select Multiple Points
	- Confluent points (upper and lower)
	- Pathway points (5-8 points)
	- Root/end points (extremities)
	2. Vary Depth According to Location
	- Superficial at muscle areas
	- Medium at organ areas
	- Deep at bone/joint areas
	3. Apply Clear Technique
	- Reinforce: slow insertion, quick withdrawal, cover hole
	- Reduce: quick insertion, slow withdrawal, leave hole open
	- Guide direction with manipulation
	4. Support with Modalities
	- Moxibustion (warm, tonify)
	- Gua sha (release exterior)
	- Cupping (draw out)
	- Plum blossom (create outlet)
	5. Treat Entire Channel
	- Don't just needle one or two points
	- Stimulate whole pathway
	- Create comprehensive effect

### 14 Foundation Principles
These principles determine when divergent channels are appropriate:
1. Three layers of the body
2. From beginning to end
3. The major channels
4. Yin-Yang paired channels and transporting points
5. Entering and exiting
6. Roots and ends
7. Fifty cycles
8. Anatomical structures and divergent channels
9. Distal needling
10. Emotions and divergent channels
11. Rivers and channels
12. The muscle channels
13. Measurements in reference to the bones
14. Needling technique methods

#### PRINCIPLE 1: THREE LAYERS OF THE BODY
- The Three Layers
	- Wei Layer (Superficial/Defensive):
		- Cutaneous regions
		- Muscle (sinew) channels
		- Connecting (luo) channels
		- Wei qi (defensive qi)
		- Function: Protection from exterior pathogens
	- Ying Layer (Middle/Nutritive):
		- Primary (major) channels
		- Internal organs
		- Ying qi (nutritive qi)
		- Function: Nourishment and organ function
	- Yuan Layer (Deep/Source):
		- Eight extraordinary channels
		- Bone and marrow
		- Jing (essence)
		- Yuan qi (source qi)
		- Function: Constitutional foundation
- Divergent Channels' Unique Capacity
	- They influence ALL THREE layers:
| Layer | Divergent Channel Connection | Treatment Capacity |
| Wei | Connect to muscle and luo channel | sCan release exterior pathogens |
| Ying | Arise from primary channels, connect to organs | Can treat organs and channels | 
| Yuan | Connect to bones, jing, extraordinary channels | Can transform constitution |

- Clinical Significance:
	- This is what makes divergent channels unique and powerful:
		- Only channel system affecting all three layers simultaneously
		- Can move substances/pathogens between layers
		- Can support treatment at any depth
- Targeting the Specific Layer
	- Diagnosis requires determining:
		- Where is the condition located? (which layer)
		- What vital substances are affected?
		- What channel system is involved?
- Treatment Strategy:
	- Superficial conditions (wei layer):
		- Shallow needling
		- Release to exterior
		- Support with gua sha, cupping
	- Middle conditions (ying layer):
		- Medium depth needling
		- Regulate organs and channels
		- Support with herbs, diet
	- Deep conditions (yuan layer):
		- Deep needling
		- Transform constitution
		- Long-term treatment with cultivation
- Divergent channels can:
	- Guide from deep to superficial (release)
	- Guide from superficial to deep (reinforce)
	- Clear all three layers simultaneously

#### PRINCIPLE 2: FROM BEGINNING TO END
- Two important acupuncture theories:
1. The Three Depths of Acupuncture
	- first depth is a shallow insertion (wei level)
	- second depth is a middle insertion (ying level)
	- third depth is deep insertion (yuan level)

- Clinical Application
| Layer | Depth | Influences | 
| Wei | Shallow | Sinew, luo, divergent channels (superficial aspect) |
| Ying | Middle | Primary channels, organs |
| Yuan | Deep | Extraordinary, divergent channels (deep aspect), jing |

#### Key: Must needle at proper depth to influence intended layer!

- 2. Contra-Lateral Needling Principle
- If the condition is located at the upper body, treat the lower body.
- If the condition is at the lower body, treat the upper body.
- If the condition is at the head, treat the foot.
- If the condition is at the loins, treat the crease of the knee.

- Two Principles Behind This:
1. Opposite Side Treatment:
	- One side of body can treat opposite side
	- Left-right correspondence
2. Following Pathogen Movement:
	- Condition can begin in one location
	- Move to another location
	- Treating origin more effective than treating current location
- Clinical Application with Divergent Channels
	- Strategy:
		- Diagnose origin of condition
		- Determine if pathogen has moved
		- Use divergent channels at origin point
		- Create contra-lateral treatment
- Example:
	- Shoulder pain on right
	- Originated in right hip (patient history)
	- Treat hip area with divergent channels
	- Include left hip (contra-lateral)
	- Support with right shoulder local points
- This provides:
	- Treatment at root cause
	- Bilateral balance
	- More effective pathogen release

### PRINCIPLE 3: THE MAJOR (PRIMARY) CHANNELS)
- Pathways (not acupuncture point lists)
- Excess and deficiency conditions
- Includes connecting (luo) channels
- Key Insight: Pathogen Transfer
	- Channel system is interwoven:
		- Pathogenic factors can move within three layers
		- Can transfer between channel systems
		- Primary channels in middle position
		- Can influence deeper and superficial levels
- How Divergent Channels Support Primary Channels
- Primary channels connect to:
	- Internal organs
	- Middle (ying) layer
- Divergent channels also connect to:
	- Same organs
	- But ALSO superficial and deep layers
- Therefore:
- When treating primary channel:
	- Divergent channels can support
	- Act as bridge to other layers
	- Enhance treatment effectiveness
- When treating organs:
	- Primary channels provide direct access
	- Divergent channels mobilize additional resources
	- Create comprehensive healing response
- Integration Strategy
- For Primary Channel Imbalances:
	- Option 1 - Primary Channel Only:
		- Select primary channel points
		- Standard treatment
	- Option 2 - Primary + Divergent:
		- Begin with divergent channel treatment
		- Mobilizes body's resources
		- Then treat primary channel
		- Creates synergy
- Example (Stomach Excess):
- Primary only:
	- Reduce ST-36, ST-44, ST-45
- Primary + Divergent:
	- Treat ST/SP divergent channels (reduce)
	- Then reduce ST-36, ST-44, ST-45
	- Creates stronger downward/outward movement

### PRINCIPLE 4: YIN-YANG PAIRED CHANNELS AND TRANSPORTING POINTS
- Transporting points (well, spring, stream, river, sea)
- Yin-Yang coupled pairs

- The Transporting Points
- Five categories per channel:
| Point Type | Element | Flow Quality | Function |
| Well (井 Jing) | Wood/Metal | Where qi springs forth | Beginning | 
| Spring (滎 Ying) | Fire | Where qi gushes out | Gliding | 
| Stream (輸 Shu) | EarthW | here qi pours | Transporting | 
| River (經 Jing) | Metal/Wood | Where qi flows profusely | Moving | 
| Sea (合 He) | Water | Where qi enters deeply | Converging |

- Important Note:
	- In Ling Shu, these are NOT five-phase points yet!
		- That came later in Nan Ching
		- Example: LU-9 is stream and source point (not "earth point")
- Ling Shu Use:
	- Transporting points treat ANY channel/organ condition
	- Most powerful point category
	- Can supplement divergent channel treatments
- Yin-Yang Paired Channels
- The Pairs:
	- Lung - Large Intestine (metal)
	- Stomach - Spleen (earth)
	- Heart - Small Intestine (fire)
	- Bladder - Kidney (water)
	- Pericardium - San Jiao (fire)
	- Gallbladder - Liver (wood)
- Why They're Connected:
	- Share same element
	- Linked through internal pathways
	- Influence each other
	- Pathogens can transfer between them
- Clinical Principle:
	- "They can be viewed as one interconnected channel, and they can treat each other."
- Application to Divergent Channels
	- Each treatment includes using Yin-Yang primary channel pairs.
	- Same strategy applies to divergent channels:
	- When treating divergent channels:
		- Always use the Yin-Yang paired channels
		- Example: Stomach excess → treat ST and SP divergent channels
		- Creates synergy
- Why This Works:
1. Natural Body Pairing:
	- Interior-exterior relationship
	- Yuan qi flows through both
	- Treating one influences other
2. Synergistic Effect:
	- 1 + 1 = 3 (more than sum of parts)
	- Combined channels create stronger reaction
	- Mobilizes more body resources
3. Balance Restoration:
	- Yin and Yang must harmonize
	- Treating both ensures balance
	- Prevents creating new imbalance

- Five-Phase Point Treatment
- Although not in Ling Shu, later tradition developed:
	- Using five-phase relationships through points:
	- Example (Liver Anger with Irritability):
		- Emotion: Anger
		- Organ: Liver
		- Element: Wood
		- Controlling element: Metal
		- Metal point on Liver channel: LV-4 (Zhong Feng, Middle Seal)
- Theory:
	- "Anger can injure the Liver, but sadness can relieve anger. Sadness is the emotion of the Lungs, which is metal. Metal can relieve anger."
- Treatment:
	- Reduce LV-4 (metal point)
	- Brings metal energy to control wood
	- Can reduce anger
- Can combine with divergent channels:
	- LV/GB divergent treatment (mobilize)
	- LV-4 reduction (control)
	- LV-5 plum blossom (release outlet)

### PRINCIPLE 5: ENTERING AND EXITING
- From Ling Shu Chapter 3
	- "The spirit is the primary qi, the guest is the evil qi. Located at the door means the evil qi pursues the primary qi at those locations where the evil and the primary qi comes out and enters. Don't just stare at the disease. Begin by knowing the evil and the primary qi and which channels are diseased. For illness, know the origins. First know which channels are diseased, then treat them at those locations."
- Translation
- "Spirit" (primary qi):
	- Body's righteous qi
	- Healthy vital force
- "Guest" (evil qi):
	- Pathogenic factor
	- External or internal
- "Door":
	- Entry and exit points
	- Where pathogens enter/leave channels

- Three Critical Diagnostic Questions
1. Which channels are diseased?
	- Not just which organs
	- Which channel system(s)
	- Specific pathways affected
2. Where did the pathogen enter?
	- Point of origin
	- Path of progression
3. Where does it need to exit?
	- Natural exit route
	- Treatment outlet

- Clinical Application
- Traditional approach:
	- Focuses on disease presentation
	- Treats where patient feels symptoms
- Ling Shu approach:
	- Identify affected channel(s)
	- Determine entry point
	- Plan exit route
	- Treat along pathway
- Divergent channels excel at:
	- Identifying pathogen location in body
	- Guiding pathogens from deep to superficial
	- Creating exit pathways (upward/outward)
	- Supporting release from body
- Example: Cold Lodged in Spine
	- Symptoms: Back pain, stiffness, cold sensation
	- Channel Diagnosis:
		- Bladder and Kidney divergent channels (flow along spine)
	- Pathogen: wind-damp-cold
	- Location: Middle of spine (T11-L4)
- Entry/Exit Strategy:
	- Entry: Lower back (BL-40 area)
	- Current location: Spine
	- Exit route: Up spine to neck (BL-10), then disperse
	- Additional outlet: Gua sha on spine
- Treatment:
	- Reduce BL/KD divergent channels
	- Create upward/outward movement
	- Gua sha provides exterior outlet
	- Moxibustion warms and expels

### PRINCIPLE 6: ROOTS AND ENDS
- What Are Roots and Ends?
	- Roots (Beginnings):
		- Where channel begins
		- Well points on extremities
		- Origin of channel flow
	- Ends (Endings):
		- Where channel terminates
		- Head/face area for most
		- Destination of channel flow
- The Roots and Ends Table (repeated for emphasis)

| Channel | Root (Beginning) | End (Ending) | Anatomical End Area |
| Tai Yang | BL-67 (Extreme Yin) | BL-1 | Eyes (Destiny Door) |
| Shao Yang | GB-44 (Cavity of Yin) | SI-19 | Ear (Window Basket/Listening Palace) | 
| Yang Ming | ST-45 (Tip Exchange) | ST-8 | Great Forehead (Corner of Head) | 
| Tai Yin | SP-1 (Hidden White) | Ren-12 | Stomach |
| Shao Yin | KD-1 (Yong Quan) | Ren-23 | Throat (Ling Quan) | 
| Jue Yin | LV-1 (Da Dun) | Ren-17 | Chest (Tan Zhong)  |
|-------------------------------------------------------|

- Why This Matters for Divergent Channels
1. Pathogen Entry Points:
	- "It is at these beginnings and endings that pathogens from the primary channels and organs can enter the divergent channels."
	- Pathogens can enter at root or end
	- Transfer from primary → divergent channels
	- Transfer from organs → divergent channels
2. Treatment Access Points:
	- Can treat divergent channels from extremities (roots)
	- Can treat from head/torso (ends)
	- Provides more treatment options than just confluent points
3. Pathway Description:
	- Roots and ends describe the range and path of channel flow:
	- From extremity to head/torso
	- Shows extent of channel influence
	- Reveals areas that can be treated
	- Different from Confluent Points
- Confluent Points:
	- Where Yin-Yang pairs unite
	- Usually at major joints (BL-40, BL-10, etc.)
- Root/End Points:
	- Begin at extremities (well points)
	- End at head/torso
	- Some overlap with confluent points, some don't
- Clinical Value:
	- Roots/ends offer additional treatment points when:
		- Confluent points insufficient
		- Need to access from extremities
		- Want to stimulate entire channel range
- Clinical Application
	- Option 1 - Use Confluent Points:
		- BL-40 (earth), BL-10 (heaven)
		- Standard divergent channel approach
	- Option 2 - Use Root/End Points:
		- BL-67 (root), BL-1 (end)
		- Stimulates entire channel from beginning to end
	- Option 3 - Combine Both:
		- Needle root point (BL-67)
		- Needle lower confluent (BL-40)
		- Needle pathway points (Hua Tuo Jia Ji)
		- Needle upper confluent (BL-10)
		- Needle end point (BL-1)
		- Creates maximum channel stimulation!
- Example Treatment Using Roots/Ends
	- Condition: Liver qi stagnation with anger
		- Root/End Approach:
			- Root: LV-1 (Da Dun) - beginning
			- Pathway: LV-5 (plum blossom - luo point)
			- End: Ren-17 (Tan Zhong) - chest ending
			- Additional: GB-1 (Liver divergent ending)
	- This approach:
		- Stimulates entire Liver channel range
		- From foot to chest
		- Releases through multiple outlets
		- More comprehensive than confluent points alone
### PRINCIPLE 7: FIFTY CYCLES
- From Ling Shu Chapter 5: "Roots and Ends"
	- "Nourishing (ying) qi circulates 50 times per day. If it does not circulate 50 times it reflects an imbalance of the channels and organs."
- What This Means
	- Normal circulation:
		- Ying qi completes 50 full cycles daily
		- Through all 12 primary channels
		- Nourishes organs and channels evenly
	- Abnormal circulation (fewer than 50):
		- Beginning of "chaos" (imbalance)
		- Channels and organs not properly nourished
		- Leads to illness
- The Two Circulation Patterns
1. Roots and Endings Flow:
	- Described in this chapter
		- From extremities to head/torso
		- Shows range of each channel
2. Nourishing Cycle (Ling Shu Chapter 16):
	- Daily meridian clock
	- Stomach → Lung → Large Intestine → ... → Liver → back to Lung
	- Plus branch to Du and Ren channels
- Both patterns are maps for:
	- Diagnosis
- Treatment planning
	- Understanding pathogen transfer
- Clinical Application
	- If ying qi cycle is disrupted:
		- Example: Lung Deficiency
			- Strategy 1 - Direct Treatment:
				- Reinforce Lung channel points
				- LU-9 (source), LU-1 (mu), etc.
			- Strategy 2 - Support Cycle Flow:
				- Treat Ren-12 (zhong wan)
				- Where ying qi cycle begins (middle of Stomach)
				- Reinforcing Ren-12 → reinforces entire cycle → benefits Lungs
				- Earth reinforcing Metal (five-phase relationship)
			- Strategy 3 - Combine with Divergent Channels:
				- Reinforce LU/LI divergent channels
				- Treat Ren-12
				- Reinforce LU-9
				- Creates comprehensive nourishment
- Imbalances Can Follow:
1. Roots/Endings Pattern:
	- From extremity to head
	- Along channel pathway
2. Ying Qi Cycle Pattern:
	- From organ to organ
	- Following daily clock sequence
- Diagnosis should consider:
	- Which pattern is patient following?
	- Where in cycle is disruption?
	- How to restore normal 50-cycle flow?
- Divergent channels help restore flow by:
	- Clearing blockages
	- Supporting circulation
	- Connecting to all channels
### PRINCIPLE 8: ANATOMICAL STRUCTURES AND DIVERGENT CHANNELS
- From Ling Shu Chapter 6
	- "Longevity or Premature Death, to be Hard or Soft"
- Key Teaching:
	- Internally: Yin and Yang (organs)
	- Externally: Yin and Yang (structures)
- The Internal Yin-Yang
	- Yin Organs (Zang):
		- Heart, Lungs, Spleen, Liver, Kidneys
		- Storage function
- Yang Organs (Fu):
	- Small Intestine, Large Intestine, Stomach, Gallbladder, Bladder, San Jiao
	- Transformation and transportation
- The External Yin-Yang
	- At the exterior:
		- Yin = Bones
		- Yang = Skin
- When Connected to Channels/Substances:
	- Skin (Yang) includes:
		- Exterior channels: sinew (muscle) channels
		- Vital substance: wei qi (defensive qi)
		- Function: protection from exterior
	- Bones (Yin) include:
		- Deep channels: eight extraordinary channels
		- Vital substances: jing (essence) and yuan qi (source qi)
		- Function: constitutional foundation
- Two Clinical Applications
1. Channels Connecting to Skin:
	- Can influence muscle channels
	- Can influence wei qi
	- Treatment affects superficial layer
2. Channels Connecting to Bones:
	- Can influence eight extraordinary channels
	- Can influence jing and yuan qi
	- Treatment affects deep layer
- Divergent Channels' Unique Position
	- Divergent channels connect to:
		- Superficial layers (skin)
		- Bones (and joints between bones)
- Therefore, divergent channels can:
	- Influence muscle channels and wei qi (through skin connection)
	- Influence extraordinary channels, jing, and yuan qi (through bone connection)
	- Treat both superficial and deep simultaneously
- This is why they can treat such a wide range of conditions!
- Clinical Example
	- Condition: Chronic knee pain (bone/joint level) with muscle tension
	- Layers Affected:
		- Wei layer: Muscle tension (muscle channels)
		- Yuan layer: Bone/joint (jing level)
	- Treatment Using This Principle:
		- Standard approach (primary channels only):
			- Needle ST-35, ST-36, SP-9, SP-10
			- May help superficial aspects
			- May miss deep bone level
		- Divergent channel approach:
			- ST/SP divergent channels
			- Connect to skin → treats muscles/wei qi
			- Connect to bones → treats jing/constitutional level
			- Add primary channel points (ST-36, SP-9)
			- Add local points around knee
		- Result:
			- Treats superficial and deep simultaneously
			- More comprehensive and effective
			- Addresses root cause (constitutional level)

### PRINCIPLE 9: DISTAL NEEDLING
- From Ling Shu Chapter 7: "On Governing the Needles"
	- Presents the Nine Methods of Needling
- Two Especially Relevant Methods
	- Method 2: "Needle the Distant Road"
		- "Needle the lower part of the body to treat conditions of the upper part of the body."
	- Method 8: "Opposite Needling"
		- "Treat the right side when disease is on the left side, and treat the left side for conditions on the right side."
- Distal Needling Theory
- Two principles:
	- 1. Upper-Lower Relationship:
		- Lower body treats upper body
		- Upper body treats lower body
		- Based on body's integrated wholeness
	- 2. Left-Right Relationship (Contra-lateral):
		- Right treats left
		- Left treats right
		- Based on body's bilateral symmetry
- Why This Works
	- Channel Connectivity:
		- All channels flow through entire body
		- Treating one area influences whole channel
		- Distal points often more powerful
- Qi Movement:
	- Needling distal guides qi toward affected area
	- Creates stronger movement than local needling alone
	- "Calls" qi to problem area
	- Reduces Local Interference:
	- Sometimes local area too inflamed to needle directly
	- Distal needling avoids aggravation
	- Treats through channel connection
- Application to Divergent Channels
	- Divergent channels particularly suited for distal needling because:
	1. Long Pathways:
		- Flow from legs to head (foot channels)
		- Flow from arms to head (hand channels)
	- Can access distant areas
	2. Confluent Points Often Distal:
		- BL-40 (knee) treats spine/head
		- ST-30 (hip) treats face/head
		- GB-30 (hip) treats face
	3. Root/End Point System:
		- Roots at extremities
		- Ends at head/torso
		- Built-in distal-to-proximal treatment
- Clinical Examples
	- Example 1: Headache
		- Location: Tai Yang (Bladder) headache
		- Distal approach:
		- Root point: BL-67 (foot)
		- Lower confluent: BL-40 (knee)
		- Treats head from legs
- Why effective:
	- Draws qi downward from head
	- Relieves excess at head
	- Uses gravity (descending)
	- Example 2: Shoulder Pain (Right)
		- Contra-lateral approach:
			- Treat left shoulder area (opposite)
			- Treat right hip/leg (lower body for upper)
		- Combine: treat left hip
			- Creates powerful qi movement to right shoulder
		- Using divergent channels:
			- Left LI/LU divergent channels (opposite)
			- Right ST/SP divergent channels (upper-lower)
			- Combined effect stronger than either alone
- The Three Depths Revisited
	- From same chapter (Ling Shu Chapter 7):
		- "Thus, the 'rule of acupuncture' says, to begin, needle shallowly in order to expel the evil qi and to let the blood and qi come forward. Afterwards, needle deeply in order to affect the yin qi's evil. Finally, needle extremely deeply in order to descend to the valley qi."
- Three Levels Confirmed:
	- Shallow = wei level (sinew, luo, divergent - superficial)
	- Middle = ying level (primary channels)
	- Deep = yuan level (extraordinary, divergent - deep, jing)
	- Treatment must needle at correct level for condition!
- Divergent Channel Distal Treatment Strategy
	- For conditions in the head/neck:
		- Step 1: Needle distal (lower body)
			- Foot divergent channels (BL/KD, GB/LV, ST/SP)
			- Root points or lower confluent points
		- Step 2: Needle pathway points (if needed)
			- Along spine, torso, neck
		- Step 3: Needle local/proximal (if needed)
			- Head/neck area
		- Upper confluent points
- This sequence:
	- Draws qi from affected area first (distal)
	- Opens pathway (middle)
	- Treats locally (proximal)
	- Most effective order

### PRINCIPLE 10: EMOTIONS AND DIVERGENT CHANNELS
- From Ling Shu Chapter 8: "The Roots of Spirit"
- Key Teaching:
	- Emotions and organs interconnected
	- Organ conditions influence emotions
	- Emotional states influence organs
- The Two-Way Relationship
	- Organ → Emotion:
		- Physical organ imbalance creates emotional symptoms
		- Example: Kidney deficiency → fear
		- Example: Liver stagnation → anger
	- Emotion → Organ:
		- Chronic emotional states damage organs
		- Example: Prolonged anger → Liver stagnation → Liver blood deficiency
		- Example: Chronic fear → Kidney depletion
- How Emotions Transfer to Channels
	- Process:
		- Stress/lifestyle affects primary channels
		- Primary channels connect to organs
		- Organs affected
		- Emotions arise (or emotions cause organ stress)
- Connecting channels hold emotions (in blood)
	- Emotions can transfer to divergent channels
	- Connecting (luo) channels:
		- "Blood channels"
		- Emotions stored in blood
		- Can transfer emotions to organs
- Divergent channels can:
	- Release emotions from luo channels
	- Release emotions from organs
	- Support emotional transformation
- Clinical Strategy for Emotional Conditions
- Three-Part Treatment:
	- Part 1 - Connecting Channels:
		- Treat luo points of affected organs
		- Release emotions from blood
		- Create outlet (plum blossom, bloodletting)
	- Part 2 - Divergent Channels:
		- Mobilize emotional energy
		- Guide toward release
		- Create upward/outward movement
	- Part 3 - Primary Channels:
		- Regulate organ function
		- Restore normal qi flow
		- Support with herbs if needed
- Example: Anger (from earlier case study)
	- Diagnosis: Liver qi stagnation, repressed anger, hun imbalance
	- Treatment:
	1. Luo channel release:
		- Plum blossom right LV-5 (Liver luo point)
		- Plum blossom left GB-37 (Gallbladder luo point)
		- Creates outlet for blood/emotions
	2. Divergent channel mobilization:
		- Reduce Ren-2 (lower confluent)
		- Reduce left GB-1 (upper confluent)
		- Reduce Du-20 (guide to head/out)
		- Reduce right GB-1 (upper confluent)
		- Re-reduce Ren-2 (complete circuit)
		- Reduce LV-14 (pathway point, Liver mu)
	3. Primary channel regulation:
		- Reduce LV-3 (source point)
		- Regulate Liver qi
	4. Supporting channels:
		- Reduce SJ-6 (guides outward through San Jiao)
		- Reduce GB-41 (horary point, assists release)
	- Result: Comprehensive emotional release treatment
- Why Divergent Channels for Emotions?
	1. Multi-layer access:
		- Emotions can lodge at any layer (wei, ying, yuan)
		- Divergent channels access all layers
	2. Constitutional transformation:
		- Chronic emotions become constitutional
		- Divergent channels reach yuan (deep) level
		- Can transform constitutional patterns
	3. Supporting role:
		- Enhance luo channel treatments
		- Support primary channel treatments
		- Create synergy
	4. Mobilization:
		- Create movement of stuck emotional energy
		- Guide toward release
		- Prevent re-lodging

### PRINCIPLE 11: RIVERS AND CHANNELS
- From Ling Shu Chapter 12
	- This chapter presents how the acupuncture channels mirror water flows in the environment.
- The Water-Channel Correspondence
	- Ancient China's major rivers were mapped to body channels:
	- The pattern of rivers matched to channels = exact distribution of divergent channels
- Key Insight:
	- "The early practitioners saw the flow of rivers and waterways as a model for vital substance flow in the body."
- The Heaven-Earth Body Division
	- Chapter 12 divides the body:
		- Heaven (上 Shang):
			- Above the waist
			- Upper body- Yang region
		- Earth (下 Xia):
			- Below the waist
			- Lower body
			- Yin region
- Confluent Points: Heaven and Earth
	- This division influences confluent point nomenclature:
| Channel Pair | Earth Point (Lower) | Heaven Point (Upper | 
| )Bladder-Kidney | BL-40 (委中 Wei Zhong, "Middle of Crook") - knee | BL-10 (天柱 Tian Zhu, "Celestial Pillar") - neck | 
| Gallbladder-Liver | Ren-2 or GB-30 - lower | GB-1 - head | 
| Stomach-Spleen | ST-30 - hip | BL-1/LI-20/ST-1 - face | 
| Small Intestine-Heart | GB-22 - chest | BL-1 - eye | 
| San Jiao-Pericardium | Ren-12 - abdomen | SJ-16/GB-12 - head | 
| Large Intestine-Lung | ST-12 - chest | LI-18 - neck |

- Clinical Application
	- Standard divergent channel treatment:
		- Needle earth (lower) confluent point first
		- Then heaven (upper) confluent point
		- Pathway points between them
		- Creates flow from earth to heaven (lower to upper)
	- Example (Bladder-Kidney):
		- Right BL-40 (earth/knee)
		- Right BL-10 (heaven/neck)
		- Left BL-10 (heaven/neck)
		- Left BL-40 (earth/knee)
		- Pathway points: Du-4, BL-23, Hua Tuo Jia Ji, etc.
- This order:
	- Follows natural upward flow of divergent channels
	- Mimics water flowing from earth (below) to heaven (above)
	- Creates ascending momentum
- Water Flow Principles Applied to Treatment
	- Rivers in nature:
		- Flow from high to low (gravity)
		- Can be dammed (creating stagnation)
		- Can flood (excess)
		- Can dry up (deficiency)
		- Smooth flow = healthy environment
- Channels in body:
	- Flow along specific pathways
	- Can be blocked (stagnation)
	- Can have excess (flooding)
	- Can have deficiency (drying up)
	- Smooth flow = health
- Divergent channels as waterways:
	- Flow upward (ascending nature)
	- Can clear blockages (dredge)
	- Can drain excesses (reduce)
	- Can nourish deficiencies (reinforce)
	- Restore smooth flow
- The Imagery in Treatment
	- When treating divergent channels, visualize:
	- Reducing:
		- Opening dam
		- Releasing flood waters
		- Clearing blockage
		- Allowing stagnant water to flow out
	- Reinforcing:
		- Directing rivers to dry areas
		- Irrigating fields
		- Nourishing the land
		- Filling reservoirs
	- Dredging:
		- Clearing river bed
		- Removing debris
		- Restoring natural flow
		- Creating smooth passage
- This imagery helps:
	- Clarify treatment intention
	- Guide needling technique
	- Enhance treatment effectiveness
	- "Where mind goes, qi follows"

### PRINCIPLE 12: THE MUSCLE CHANNELS
- This chapter presents:
	- Muscle (sinew/tendon) channel pathways
	- Conditions of each muscle channel
- Monthly susceptibilities
	- Common Patterns:
		- Spasms and cramping along pathways
		- Pain in muscles/tendons
		- Joint dysfunction
		- Limited range of motion
		- Cold/heat affecting muscles
- Pathogenic Factors:
	- Wind (most common)
	- Cold
	- Damp
	- Combination (wind-damp, wind-cold, damp-cold)
- Divergent Channels Support Muscle Channels
- Two Functions:
	- Function 1: Release Pathogens FROM Muscle Channels
	- Process:
		- Pathogen lodges in muscle channel (wind-damp-cold)
		- Divergent channel treatment mobilizes pathogen
		- Moves pathogen from deep muscles to surface
		- Creates upward/outward movement
	- Then:
		- Muscle channel treatment releases from body
		- Add modality: gua sha, cupping, plum blossom
	- Example (Back Pain):
		- Muscle channel affected:
		- Bladder sinew channel (para-spinal muscles)
	- Treatment:
		- Divergent channels: BL/KD divergent (move pathogen up/out)
		- Muscle channels: Superficial needling along muscles
		- Release modality: Gua sha on entire back
		- Warm: Moxibustion to expel cold
	- Function 2: Release Pathogens IN Divergent Channels
		- Process:
			- Pathogen transfers from muscle → divergent channels
			- Now lodged in divergent channel pathways
			- Divergent channel treatment releases
			- Guides back to surface
			- Muscle channel/modality completes release
			- Why This Transfer Happens:
				- Channels interconnected
				- Body diverts pathogens to protect deeper organs
				- Divergent channels can store pathogens temporarily
				- If not treated → becomes chronic
- Combined Treatment Strategy
- For Muscle Channel Conditions:
	- Option 1 - Muscle Channels Only:
		- Ashi points
		- Superficial needling
		- Gua sha/cupping
	- Option 2 - Muscle + Divergent:
		- Divergent channel treatment (mobilize deep pathogens)
		- Muscle channel treatment (release superficial)
		- Modality (create outlet: gua sha, cupping, plum blossom)
		- Moxibustion (if cold present)
	- Option 2 is more comprehensive and often more effective
- Example Protocol
		- Condition: Gallbladder muscle channel - lateral leg/thigh cramping
	- Treatment:
		- Part 1 - Divergent Channels:
			- Reduce GB/LV divergent channels
			- Ren-2, GB-1, GB-1, Ren-2
			- Mobilizes stuck qi in channel
		- Part 2 - Muscle Channel:
			- Superficial needling along GB sinew channel
			- GB-31, GB-34, GB-39 (shallow)
			- Ashi points along lateral leg
		- Part 3 - Release:
			- Gua sha lateral leg/thigh
			- Allows wind-damp to release
			- Creates visible outlet (sha/redness)
		- Part 4 - Support:
			- GB-40 (source point) if deficiency
			- GB-38 (fire point) if excess heat
			- Adjust based on diagnosis
- Monthly Cycle Application
- From Chapter 6:
	- Each muscle channel relates to a lunar month.
	- If condition appears/worsens in specific month:
		- Check that month's muscle channel
		- Likely involved even if not obvious location
	- Example:
		- Patient's shoulder pain worse every February
		- February = Bladder muscle channel
		- Even if pain in shoulder (LI/SJ area)
		- Include Bladder muscle channel in diagnosis
		- May be root cause or contributing factor
	- Treatment could include:
		- Bladder muscle channel points
		- Bladder divergent channel
		- Local shoulder points

### PRINCIPLE 13: MEASUREMENTS IN REFERENCE TO THE BONES
- From Ling Shu Chapter 14
	- This chapter provides detailed measurements of major bones.
	- Why an entire chapter on bones?
- The Significance of Bones in Chinese Medicine
- Chapter 13 (before bone chapter):
	- Muscle channels
- Chapter 14 (bone chapter):
	- Bone measurements
- Why together?
	- Tendons connect to bones
	- They influence each other
	- Anatomical unit
- Bones' Dual Nature
	- Anatomically (Superficial/Wei Layer):
		- Bones attach to tendons and muscles
		- Part of musculo-skeletal system
		- Palpable, external structure
	- Energetically (Deep/Yuan Layer):
		- Bones contain jing (essence)
		- Western: bone marrow = stem cells
		- Connected to eight extraordinary channels
		- Source qi (yuan qi)
		- Constitutional level
- Bones = bridge between wei (superficial) and yuan (deep)!

#### Bones and Vital Substances
| Aspect | Connection | Substance | 
| External | Muscles, tendons | Wei qi (defensive) | 
| Internal | Marrow, jing | Yuan qi (source) | 
| Channels | Eight extraordinary | Jing (essence) |
| Function | Structure, protection | Constitutional foundation | 

#### Clinical Significance for Divergent Channels
- Divergent channels:
	1. Begin/End at Bones:
		- Confluent points mostly at major bones/joints
		- BL-40 (knee joint)
		- BL-10 (cervical vertebrae)
		- ST-30 (hip joint/pubis)
		- GB-30 (hip joint)
	2. Flow Through Joint Spaces:
		- Large bones have spaces around them (joints)
		- Pathogens can accumulate in these spaces
		- Divergent channels access these areas
	3. Influence Both Wei and Yuan:
		- Through external bone connection → wei qi, muscles
		- Through internal bone connection → yuan qi, jing, extraordinary channels
#### Pathogen Accumulation in Joints
- Process:
	- Pathogen enters body (wind-damp-cold)
	- Body diverts to joint spaces (protective mechanism)
	- Protects internal organs temporarily
	- But creates chronic joint condition if not cleared
- Why joints?
	- Large spaces available
	- Away from vital organs
	- Can be contained there
	- If not cleared:
		- Becomes chronic arthritis, bi syndrome
		- Affects bones, tendons, muscles
		- Influences extraordinary channels (constitutional)
#### Divergent Channels Excel at Bone/Joint Treatment
- Because they:
	1. Access Joint Spaces:
		- Confluent points at major joints
		- Pathways flow through joints
		- Can reach accumulated pathogens
	2. Influence Multiple Layers:
		- Wei layer (muscles around bones)
		- Yuan layer (jing in bones)
	- Can clear pathogens AND strengthen constitution
	3. Connect to Extraordinary Channels:
		- Through bone/jing connection
		- Can transform constitutional weakness
		- Prevent future accumulation
#### Treatment Strategy for Joint Conditions
- Example: Chronic Knee Pain
	- Layers involved:
		- Wei: Muscle tension around knee
		- Ying: Primary channel stagnation
		- Yuan: Bone/jing level depletion or pathogen lodging
	- Standard approach (primary channels only):
		- ST-35, ST-36, SP-9, SP-10, GB-34
		- Treats ying layer primarily
		- May miss wei and yuan layers
	- Divergent channel approach:
		- Divergent channels (wei + yuan):
		- ST/SP divergent channels
		- BL/KD divergent channels (if back of knee)
		- Access both superficial and deep
		- Primary channels (ying):
		- ST-36, SP-9 (support divergent treatment)
		- He-sea points for joint
		- Local points:
			- Surround knee (ST-35, SP-10, etc.)
		- Ashi points
		- Modalities:
			- Moxibustion (warm, expel cold from bones)
			- Gua sha or cupping (release from muscles)
	- This treats:
		- Muscles (wei)
		- Channels and organs (ying)
		- Bones and jing (yuan)
		- Comprehensive treatment
- Hua Tuo on Movement
- Famous quote:
	- "The moving hinge collects no rust."
- Application:
	- Daily movement clears joints
	- Prevents pathogen accumulation
	- Maintains smooth qi/blood flow
	- Prevents chronic conditions
- Divergent channels:
	- Assist in clearing joint spaces
	- Support healthy circulation
	- Prevent "rust" (stagnation/pathogen accumulation)
- Treatment + Qi Gong/Tai Chi:
	- Acupuncture clears existing stagnation
	- Movement prevents future accumulation
	- Combined = long-term health
### PRINCIPLE 14: NEEDLING TECHNIQUE METHODS
- From Ling Shu Chapter 1
	- "The method of acupuncture is to tonify hollowness, disperse fullness, and dredge stasis. When these methods are applied, the pathogen will be weakened. Needling slow, then quick, produces tonification. Needling quick, then slow, produces reducing."
#### The Three Major Treatment Strategies
1. Reinforcing (補 Bu) - Tonify Hollowness:
	- Guide vital substances TO an area
	- Supplement deficiency
	- Nourish and strengthen
2. Reducing (瀉 Xie) - Disperse Fullness:
	- Guide substances/pathogens AWAY from area
	- Drain excess
	- Release and expel
3. Dredging (疏通 Shu Tong) - Clear Stasis:
	- Unblock stagnation
	- Restore circulation
	- Regulate flow
- All treatments should include ONE of these actions!
#### The Three Reinforcing Methods
- Method 1 - Respiration:
	- Insert needle: On patient's exhalation
	- Withdraw needle: On patient's inhalation
	- Rationale: Exhalation = qi entering body, draws qi to point
- Method 2 - Insertion Speed:
	- Insert needle: Slowly
	- Withdraw needle: Quickly
	- Rationale: Slow in = gather; quick out = retain
- Method 3 - Covering the Hole:
	- After withdrawal: Immediately cover hole with cotton/finger
	- Rationale: Prevents qi from escaping
#### The Three Reducing Methods
- Method 1 - Respiration:
	- Insert needle: On patient's inhalation
	- Withdraw needle: On patient's exhalation
	- Rationale: Inhalation = qi exiting body, follows qi out
- Method 2 - Insertion Speed:
	- Insert needle: Quickly
	- Withdraw needle: Slowly
	- Rationale: Quick in = pierce pathogen; slow out = draws pathogen out
- Method 3 - Covering the Hole:
	- After withdrawal: Wait before covering (or don't cover)
	- Rationale: Allows pathogen to continue exiting
- Applying to Yin and Yang Organs
	- Yin Organs (Zang) - Storage Function
	- Nature: Gather and store
	- When deficient:
		- Apply reinforcing methods
		- Guide qi TO organ
		- Strengthen storage capacity
		- Example: Kidney Deficiency
		- Treatmen:
			- Reinforce Kidney points
			- Use reinforcing respiration (needle on exhalation, withdraw on inhalation)
			- Use reinforcing speed (slow in, quick out)
			- Cover hole immediately
			- Can use all three or choose most appropriate
	- Yang Organs (Fu) - Transformation Function
		- Nature: Empty and release
		- When excess:
		- Apply reducing methods
		- Guide pathogenic qi AWAY from organ
		- Facilitate emptying/releasing
		- Example: Stomach Fire
		- Treatment:
			- Reduce Stomach points (ST-44, ST-45)
			- Use reducing respiration (needle on inhalation, withdraw on exhalation)
			- Use reducing speed (quick in, slow out)
			- Leave hole open/uncovered
			- Can combine methods

#### Application to Divergent Channels
- Reinforcing Divergent Channels
	- When:
		- Organ deficiency
		- Need to guide resources TO area
		- Supporting restoration
	- Method:
		- Confluent points: Reinforce with slow in, quick out
		- Pathway points: Reinforce if needed
		- Primary channel points: Reinforce source/sea points
		- Direction: Guide qi inward/downward toward organs
	- Example: Reinforce Spleen/Stomach
		- Divergent channel treatment:
		- Left ST-30 (reinforce)
		- Left ST-1 or LI-20 (reinforce)
		- Du-20 (guide across)
		- Right ST-1 or LI-20 (reinforce)
		- Right ST-30 (reinforce)
		- Plus:
			- Ren-12 (reinforce - on pathway, Stomach mu point)
		- SP-3, ST-36 (reinforce - source/sea points)
		- All needled with reinforcing technique
- Reducing Divergent Channels
	- When:
		- Organ excess
		- Pathogen needs releasing
		- Clearing heat/stagnation
		- Method:
			- Confluent points: Reduce with quick in, slow out
			- Pathway points: Reduce to move pathogen along
			- Luo points: Plum blossom/bloodlet (create outlet)
			- Direction: Guide qi outward/upward away from organs
	- Example: Reduce Liver Fire (Anger)
		- Divergent channel treatment:
		- Ren-2 (reduce)
		- Left GB-1 (reduce)
		- Du-20 (reduce - guides upward)
		- Right GB-1 (reduce)
		- Re-stimulate Ren-2 (reduce)
	- Plus:
		- LV-14 (reduce - pathway point, Liver mu)
		- LV-5, GB-37 (plum blossom - luo points, creates outlet)
		- LV-3 (reinforce to move qi upward, paradoxical technique)
	- All needled with reducing technique except LV-3
- Dredging Divergent Channels
	- When:
		- Stagnation without clear excess/deficiency
		- Need to restore circulation
		- Bi syndrome (wind-damp-cold lodged)
		- Method:
			- Confluent points: Even technique or alternate reinforce/reduce
			- Pathway points: Focus on stagnant areas
			- Distal points: Open flow
			- Modalities: Gua sha, cupping, moxibustion essential
	- Example: Bi Syndrome in Spine
		- Divergent channel treatment:
		- BL-40 (even technique or slight reduce)
		- BL-10 (even technique or slight reduce)
		- Pathway: Hua Tuo Jia Ji at affected levels (even)
		- Du channel points (even)
	- Plus:
		- BL-11 (influential point of bone)
		- SI-3, BL-65 (stream points for bi syndrome)
		- Moxibustion (warm, move stagnation)
		- Gua sha (release pathogen)
- The Importance of Technique
	- Without proper technique:
		- Treatments less effective
		- May not achieve goal (reinforce/reduce/dredge)
		- Body receives unclear message
	- With proper technique:
		- Clear message sent to body
		- Body responds more effectively
		- Treatment goal achieved
	- Results more consistent
- Integration: Technique + Strategy + Intention
	- Complete treatment requires:
	1. Clear Diagnosis:
		- Which channels affected?
		- Which layer (wei/ying/yuan)?
		- What needs to happen (reinforce/reduce/dredge)?
	2. Appropriate Channel Selection:
		- Primary channels?
		- Divergent channels?
		- Combined approach?
	3. Correct Points:
		- Confluent points
		- Pathway points
		- Supporting points
	4. Proper Technique:
		- Reinforcing methods
		- Reducing methods
		- Dredging methods
	5. Clear Intention:
		- Where should qi go?
		- What should happen?
		- Visualize the goal
- When all five align:
	- Treatment highly effective
	- Body responds powerfully
	- Healing accelerated
#### SYNTHESIS: THE 14 PRINCIPLES WORKING TOGETHER
- How These Principles Integrate
- When patient presents:
	1. Three Layers - Determine depth of condition
	2. Nine Needles - Select appropriate technique for layer
	3. Major Channels - Identify primary channel involvement
	4. Yin-Yang Pairs - Treat paired channels together
	5. Entering/Exiting - Know where pathogen entered, plan exit
	6. Roots/Ends - Use full channel range
	7. Fifty Cycles - Consider ying qi circulation
	8. Anatomical Structures - Assess bone/skin involvement
	9. Distal Needling - Treat from distance when appropriate
	10. Emotions - Evaluate psycho-emotional component
	11. Rivers/Channels - Visualize flow, use heaven/earth points
	12. Muscle Channels - Check superficial involvement
	13. Bones - Assess constitutional/jing level
	14. Needling Technique - Apply reinforce/reduce/dredge

#### Two Primary Functions:
- Direct treatment - conditions in divergent channel pathways
- Support treatment - conditions in any other channel system
#### FOUNDATION NEEDLING METHODS
- The Three Treatment Goals
- Every divergent channel treatment should include ONE of these:
1. Reinforce (補 Bu):
	- Goal: Guide vital substances TO an area
	- Action: Reinforce an organ or channel
	- When: Deficiency patterns
2. Reduce (瀉 Xie):
	- Goal: Guide pathogenic factors or substances AWAY
	- Action: Release pathogenic factors or excess
	- When: Excess patterns
	- Usually: To the exterior (outward)
3. Dredge (疏通 Shu Tong):
	- Goal: Increase circulation to clear stagnations
	- Action: Restore normal flow
	- When: Stagnation without clear excess/deficiency
#### HOW DIVERGENT CHANNELS MOBILIZE RESOURCES
- The Energy Field Concept
- Divergent channels are energy fields (channels) that:
	- Influence other channels
	- Influence entire body
	- Create reactions throughout connected systems
	- Permeate the channels they're connected to
- Think of them as:
	- Catalyst for body's healing response
	- Coordinator of multiple channel systems
	- Mobilizer of body's resources
- The Linking Function
	- Divergent channels are one of the most potent channel systems for linking:
	- Channels to channels
	- Areas to areas
	- Layers to layers
	- Resources to needs
- This linking brings:
	- Clarity of treatment focus
	- Mobilization of body's healing power
	- Comprehensive treatment response

#### The Body's Messages
- Ling Shu emphasizes:
	- Importance of knowing which channels are imbalanced
	- Symptoms/conditions/diseases identify channels/organs
	- Qualities and correspondences are body's messages
	- Clarity about affected channel/organ is essential
- This is the body speaking - we must listen!

#### The Practitioner's Message
- Equally important:
	- Order of channels treated = message to body
	- Order of needle insertion = critical part of message
	- Exact sequence creates specific effect
- The treatment is a conversation:
	- Body tells us what's wrong (diagnosis)
	- We respond with clear message (treatment order)
- The Treatment Goal
	- When needling divergent channels:
		- Primary Goal:
		- Stimulate the channels
		- Create reaction along pathways
		- Activate their connections
	- This reaction:
		- Forms basis of treatment effectiveness
		- Mobilizes body's resources
		- Creates healing synergy
- Two Main Functions of the Reaction
	- Function 1 - Within Its Own Channels:
		- Reaction in divergent channel itself
		- Reaction in Yin-Yang paired divergent channel
		- Creates movement/change within the pair
	- Function 2 - Throughout the Body:
		- Reaction affects other channel systems
		- Influences vital substances
		- Affects pathogenic factors
		- Impacts entire treatment
- Example: Chronic Anger Treatment
- Patient: Chronic anger, wants to release pattern
	- Diagnosis:
		- Liver qi stagnation
		- Repressed anger
		- Hun spirit repressed
	- Treatment Strategy:
		- Part 1 - Luo Channel (Blood/Emotion Release):
			- Plum blossom or bloodlet Liver and Gallbladder luo points
			- Creates outlet for anger to exit
			- Releases emotional qi stored in blood
- Part 2 - Divergent Channel (Mobilization):
	- Gallbladder/Liver divergent channel treatment
	- Guides anger qi to surface
	- Brings to luo points for release
- Part 3 - Modality Enhancement:
	- Bloodletting, plum blossom, gua sha, or moxibustion
	- Provides physical outlet
	- Completes release process
- How They Work Together:
	- Divergent channels guide emotional energy outward/upward
	- Luo channel treatment provides outlet
	- Modality ensures complete release
- Synergy:
	- Each part enhances the others
	- Combined effect greater than sum of parts
	- Comprehensive emotional release

#### A FRAMEWORK FOR DIVERGENT CHANNEL TREATMENT PLANS
#### The Treatment Design Process
- After diagnosis and channel selection, ask:
	- "How do I stimulate the entire channel(s)?"
	- Not just one or two points - the ENTIRE pathway!

#### The Five-Module Framework
- Module 1: Treat Confluent Points
	- Order:
		- Lower confluent point (earth)
		- Upper confluent point (heaven)
	- Purpose:
		- Stimulates channel
		- Creates reaction in channels
		- Activates Yin-Yang pair
	- Technique:
		- Reinforce OR reduce (match treatment goal)
	- Enhancement:
		- Can needle Du-20 between upper confluent points
		- Helps move treatment from one side to other
		- Increases energetic influence
	- Example (Spleen/Stomach Reinforcement):
		- Left ST-30 (lower confluent)
		- Left ST-1 (upper confluent)
		- Du-20 (guide across)
		- Right ST-1 (upper confluent)
		- Right ST-30 (lower confluent)
- Module 2: Pathway Points
	- Selection criteria:
		- Points in anatomical area of condition
		- Points with functions treating the condition
		- Points that stimulate entire channel
	- Number of points:
		- Enough to stimulate entire pathway
		- Generally 2-8 points
		- Individual practitioner skill determines optimal number
	- Purpose:
		- Enhance channel stimulation
		- Target specific areas
		- Create comprehensive effect
	- Example (Spleen/Stomach Reinforcement):
		- Ren-12 (on pathway, Stomach mu point, reinforces both)
- Module 3: Yin-Yang Pair Channel
- Apply same strategy as Module 1-2:
	- Confluent points of paired channel
	- Pathway points of paired channel
- Why:
	- Creates Yin-Yang balance
	- Synergistic effect
	- Stronger reaction
- Example (Spleen/Stomach):
	- Spleen divergent confluent: ST-30, BL-1
	- Already included in Module 1
	- Ren-12 benefits both (already in Module 2)
- Module 4: Other Channel Systems
- Select from wide range of acupuncture points:
	- For organ deficiency, consider:
		- Source points (yuan)
		- Sea points (he)
		- Front mu points
		- Back shu points
		- Five-phase reinforcement points
	- For organ excess, consider:
		- Source points (for Yang organs - helps empty)
		- Sea points
		- Luo points (especially with bloodletting/plum blossom)
		- Five-phase reduction points
		- Clearing/draining points
	- Example (Spleen/Stomach Reinforcement):
		- SP-3 (source point)
		- ST-36 (sea point, also sea of grain with ST-30)
- Module 5: Modalities
	- Add healing modalities for synergy:
		- Common modalities:
			- Moxibustion (warm, tonify, expel cold)
			- Tui na / massage (move qi/blood, relax muscles)
			- Gua sha (release to exterior, bring pathogens to surface)
			- Cupping (draw out, release stagnation)
			- Plum blossom (create outlet, gentle bloodletting)
			- Lancet bloodletting (stronger release)
			- Liniments (topical herbs)
	- Combining modalities with divergent channels:
		- Increases treatment effectiveness
		- Provides additional pathways for healing
		- Enhances specific treatment goals
- KEYS TO CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS
1. Know the Pathways
- Essential:
	- Study pathway descriptions thoroughly
	- Memorize confluent points
	- Understand anatomical areas covered
	- Know which organs/areas connected
- Why:
	- Can't treat what you don't know
- Pathway knowledge = point selection
- Understanding pathways = understanding functions
2. Include Points Along Pathways
- Not just 1-2 points!
- Classical approach:
	- Multiple points along pathway
	- Stimulates entire channel
	- Creates comprehensive effect
- Modern tendency:
	- Only treat 1-2 confluent points
	- Misses full potential
	- Less effective
- Author's recommendation:
	- Treat confluent points
	- Add 3-6 pathway points
	- Stimulate entire channel
	- Much more effective
3. Needling Technique Matters
- One of most important contributors to effectiveness:
- Include:
	- Reinforcing method (when reinforcing)
	- Reducing method (when reducing)
	- Even method (when dredging)
	- Clear intention
	- Appropriate manipulation
- As Ling Shu teaches:
	- Proper technique sends clear message to body
	- Body responds more effectively
	- Results more consistent
4. Order of Insertion Creates Synergy
- Plan exact order before needling:
	- Consider:
		- Which channels first?
		- Which points on those channels?
		- In what sequence?
		- Left or right first?
		- Distal to proximal or reverse?
		- The order creates:
			- Energetic flow
			- Directional movement
			- Healing synergy
	- Example order (Liver/Gallbladder Reduction):
		- Ren-2 (earth confluent - start flow)
		- Left GB-1 (heaven confluent - establish left)
		- Right GB-1 (heaven confluent - establish right)
		- Re-stimulate Ren-2 (complete circuit)
		- LV-14 (pathway point, Liver mu)
		- LV-5 plum blossom (luo point - outlet)
		- GB-37 plum blossom (luo point - outlet)
	- This specific order:
		- Starts at earth (lower)
		- Moves to heaven (upper)
		- Balances left/right
		- Returns to earth (completes circuit)
		- Adds organ support
		- Creates outlet for release

#### THE DIVERGENT CHANNELS AND THE CHANNEL SYSTEM
##### Key principle:
	- "The divergent channels can be used with all the channel systems."
- Five Methods of Support

#### METHOD 1: Treating Divergent Channel Pathways
- Direct treatment of conditions in divergent channel pathways
- Macro view:
	- "All pathologies and imbalances of the body have the potential to move into the divergent channels."
- Process:
	- Make diagnosis
	- Create treatment plan (reinforce/reduce/dredge)
	- Select divergent channels based on pathway location
- Example: Bi Syndrome in Spine
	- Condition:
		- Wind-damp-cold lodged in spine
		- Location: T11 to L4
		- Pain, stiffness, cold sensation
	- Diagnosis:
		- Bi syndrome
	- Pathogen: wind-damp-cold
	- Location: Bladder/Kidney divergent channel pathways
	- Treatment Goal:
		- Resolve and clear bi syndrome
		- Move pathogen from spine
		- Release from body
	- Treatment Plan:
	- Part 1 - Divergent Channels (Reduce):
		- Right BL-40 (earth confluent)
		- Right BL-10 (heaven confluent)
		- Left BL-10 (heaven confluent)
		- Left BL-40 (earth confluent)
		- Du-20 (assists left-right movement)
		- Du-16, Du-6 (on pathways, spine level)
		- Hua Tuo Jia Ji at affected vertebrae (local pathway)
	- Part 2 - Primary Channels (Support):
		- SI-3, BL-65 (stream points - treat bi syndrome)
		- BL-11 (influential point of bone)
	- Part 3 - Modalities:
		- Moxibustion (warm, expel cold, move stagnation)
		- Tui na on local area (before needling)
		- Gua sha (after needling - provides outlet)
	- Part 4 - Promote Urination (Additional Release):
		- BL-64, BL-28 (source and back shu - promote urination)
		- Additional pathway for pathogen release
	- Goal:
		- Create energetic flow moving bi syndrome upward/outward
		- Multiple outlets for release
		- Comprehensive clearing
#### METHOD 2: Supporting Internal Organs and Primary Channels
- Divergent channels assist organ and primary channel treatments
- Two scenarios:
	- Scenario A - Organ Deficiency:
	- Example: Spleen Qi Deficiency
	- Goal: Reinforce Spleen
	- Strategy:
		- Select primary channel points (SP-3, SP-6, ST-36)
		- Add Spleen/Stomach divergent channels
		- Reinforce both systems
	- How divergent channels help:
		- Create momentum guiding qi TO Spleen
		- Mobilize body's resources
		- Enhance primary channel treatment
		- Stronger reinforcement
	- Treatment:
		- ST/SP divergent channels (reinforce)
		- Left ST-30, left BL-1, Du-20, right BL-1, right ST-30
		- Pathway point
			- Ren-12 (Stomach mu, on pathway)
		- Primary channel points
			- SP-3 (source), ST-36 (sea)
	- Synergy:
		- Divergent channels mobilize
		- Primary channels direct to organ
		- Ren-12 supports both
		- Comprehensive reinforcement
	- Scenario B - Organ Excess:
	- Example: Stomach Fire
		- Goal: Clear Stomach fire
	- Strategy:
		- Reduce Spleen/Stomach divergent channels
			- Assists in releasing and clearing fire
			- Support with primary channel reduction points
		- How divergent channels help:
			- Create momentum guiding fire AWAY from Stomach
			- Establish upward/outward movement
			- Enhance primary channel clearing function
	- Treatment:
		- ST/SP divergent channels (reduce)
		- Reduce confluent points
		- Primary channel points (reduce)
		- ST-44, ST-45 (clear heat, fire point)
		- ST-36 (regulate)
	- Result:
		- Divergent channels mobilize fire outward
		- Primary points clear and regulate
		- More effective than primary channels alone
#### METHOD 3: Supporting Muscle Channels
- Divergent channels enhance muscle channel treatments
- Example: Back Pain - Para-spinal Muscles
- Condition:
	- Pain along para-spinal muscles
	- Stiffness, tension
	- Possible bi syndrome
- Diagnosis:
	- Bladder muscle channel affected
	- Possible wind-damp-cold
	- Muscle tension and spasm
- Treatment Strategy:
	- Part 1 - Divergent Channels:
		- BL/KD divergent channels
		- Create upward/outward movement
		- Mobilize pathogen from deep to superficial
	- Part 2 - Muscle Channels:
		- Superficial needling along muscles
		- Stimulate wei qi
		- Relax muscles
	- Part 3 - Release:
		- Gua sha, cupping, or plum blossom
		- Brings pathogen to surface
		- Visible outlet (sha/redness)
	- Part 4 - Warm (if cold present):
		- Moxibustion
		- Expels cold
		- Warms channels
- Why combine:
	- Divergent channels: move from deep to superficial
	- Muscle channels: release from superficial
	- Modality: complete the release
	- Comprehensive treatment of all layers

#### METHOD 4: Supporting Connecting Channels
- Classical application:
- Connecting channels treat blood conditions and emotions
- Emotions stored in blood
- Divergent channels support by:
	- Bringing emotional energy to surface
	- Creating movement of stuck emotions
	- Enhancing luo channel release function
- Example: Repressed Liver Qi, Hun Imbalance
- Condition:
	- Years of repressed anger
	- Liver qi stagnation
	- Hun spirit blocked
- Patient wants to release
- Treatment Strategy:
	- Part 1 - Luo Channel Treatment:
		- Plum blossom right LV-5 (Liver luo point)
		- Plum blossom left GB-37 (Gallbladder luo point)
		- Creates outlet for emotional release
		- Blood letting allows emotions (stored in blood) to exit
	- Part 2 - Divergent Channel Treatment:
		- LV/GB divergent channels (reduce)
		- Brings emotional energy TO surface
		- Guides toward luo points for release
		- Mobilizes stuck emotional qi

		- ST-12 (on pathway)
		- Needle Ren-17 with REDUCING method
		- Gua sha ST-12:
			- Allows heat to release from Heart and Small Intestine
		- Creates physical outlet
		- Brings heat to surface
	- Part 2 - Luo Channel Release:
		- Plum blossom SI-7 bilaterally (Small Intestine luo point)
		- Rationale for SI-7:
			- Luo point of Small Intestine
			- Small Intestine is Yin-Yang pair with Heart
			- Luo points can release heat from channels
			- Creates outlet for Heart fire
- Rationale
	- Why reduce Heart fire for insomnia:
		- Heart fire rises and disturbs shen
		- Shen cannot settle at night
		- Can't fall asleep
- Divergent channel treatment:
	- Clears heat from Heart and Small Intestine channels and organs
	- GB-22/BL-1: confluent points activate channels
	- Ren-17: Heart mu point on pathway (reduces Heart directly)
	- ST-12: pathway point
	- Gua sha ST-12:
- Physical method to draw heat out
	- Visible release (redness)
	- Completes release process

- Diagnosis:
	- Pericardium deficiency
- Treatment Plan
- Goals:
	- Reinforce Pericardium and San Jiao divergent channels
	- Reinforce zhi (Kidneys - willpower)
- Theory:
	- Zhi and Kidneys contain will
	- Reinforcing Kidneys/zhi/will → ability to take responsibility
	 - Pericardium (Heart protector) + willpower → integrity in relationships
- Treatment Strategy (2 Main Parts)
	- Part 1 - Divergent Channels (Reinforce):
		- Confluent points:
			- Ren-12 (earth confluent)
			- SJ-16 (heaven confluent)
		- Additional pathway point:
			- PC-7 (source point of Pericardium)
	- All needled with REINFORCING method
	- Function:
		- Stimulates PC/SJ divergent channels

			- Yin Wei points:
				- KD-9, SP-16, LV-14
	- Treatment order if including:
		- Yin Wei channel (right side - reduce to release pattern)
		- PC/SJ divergent channels (reinforce Pericardium)
		- Primary channels (KD-3, Ren-6, PC-7)
	- Rationale:
		- Release old pattern first (Yin Wei)
		- Build new capacity second (divergent + primary)
- Rationale
- Why Pericardium:
	- Heart protector
		- Relates to how we interact with world
		- Shields/protects our true heart
		- Taking responsibility requires healthy Pericardium
- Why Kidneys/Zhi:
	- Zhi = willpower
	- Ability to follow through
	- Courage to face oneself
	- Will to change
- Pericardium-Kidney relationship:
	- PC can be viewed as part of Shao Yin (like Heart)
	- Heart-Kidney = jing-shen connection
	- PC-Kidney = similar energetic relationship
	- Reinforcing both creates comprehensive treatment
- Long-term approach:
	- This is constitutional/behavioral pattern
	- May require multiple treatments
	- Support with therapy (already doing)
	- Cultivation practices could help (meditation, Qi Gong)

### CASE 6: GRIEF AND SADNESS
- Patient: 61-year-old female
- Complaint:
	- Severe sadness, depression, grief
	- From loss of husband 5 years ago
	- No history of unusual emotional conditions before this
	- Difficult time expressing feelings to others
	- Has internalized/suppressed emotions
	- In therapy for 6 months, feels it's helped
		- Wants to be able to express emotions
		- Wants to begin moving forward in life
- Diagnosis:
	- Sadness, depression, grief from loss
	- Po disharmony (Lung shen)
	- Suppressed/internalized emotions
- Treatment Plan
- Goal:
	- Release emotions from Lung and Large Intestine channel system
	- Support emotional expression
	- Free po spirit
- Systems to treat:
	- Connecting channels (emotional release)
	- Divergent channels (mobilization)
	- Primary channels (organ support)

- Treatment Strategy (3 Parts)
- Treatment must be performed in this exact order:
	- Part 1 - Luo Channel Release (Outlet Creation):
		- Points:
			- Plum blossom right LU-7 (Lung luo point)
			- Plum blossom left LI-6 (Large Intestine luo point)
		- Why this polarity:
			- Lung = Yin channel → corresponds to right side
			- Large Intestine = Yang channel → corresponds to left side
	- Treating matched polarity increases effectiveness
	- Function:
		- Luo points influence blood/emotions
		- Plum blossom creates gentle outlet
		- Allows imbalanced emotional energy to release
	- Part 2 - Divergent Channel Mobilization (Reduce/Clear):
		- Confluent points:
			- ST-12 (earth confluent for LU/LI)
			- LI-18 (heaven confluent)
		- Pathway points:
			- LU-1
			- LI-15
			- GB-21
		- All needled with REDUCING method
	- Function:
		- Stimulates divergent channels
		- Moves emotional energy upward/outward
		- Guides toward release (to luo points treated in Part 1)
		- LU-1, LI-15, GB-21: pathway points assist release from Lungs and Large Intestine
	- Part 3 - Primary Channel Completion:
		- Points:
			- LU-8 (channel ditch, horary point - metal point on metal channel)
			- LU-3 (window of sky point)
		- Both needled with REDUCING method
	- Function:
		- LU-8 (Channel Ditch):
			- Horary point (metal on metal = powerful)
			- "Ditch" imagery: draws stagnation from channel
		- Assists releasing sadness/depression/grief from Lung channel
		- LU-3 (Window of Sky):
			- Opens communication heaven-earth
			- Assists releasing po emotional energy from body
			- Facilitates expression (opening "window")
	- Rationale
		- Three-part sequential treatment:
			- Why this order:
			- 1. Create outlet first (luo channels):
			- Emotions must have somewhere to go
			- Plum blossom provides gentle physical release
			- Prepares pathway
	2. Mobilize second (divergent channels):
		- Emotions suppressed/internalized (deep)
		- Divergent channels access deep (yuan) layer
		- Move emotions from deep to superficial
		- Guide toward outlets (luo points)
	3. Complete third (primary channels):
		- LU-8: draws from "ditch" (stagnant areas)
		- LU-3: opens "window" (expression pathway)
		- Ensures complete release
- Why LU/LI focus:
	- Grief/sadness = Lung emotions
	- Po = Lung shen
	- Internalization = po issue (isolation/polarity)
	- Large Intestine crosses midline (polarity channel)
	- Both must be treated for complete release
	- Supporting the grief process:
		- This is natural grieving
		- Needs to be expressed (not suppressed)
		- Treatment facilitates healthy expression
		- Not "removing" grief but allowing flow
		- Supports moving through process
- Long-term support:
	- Continue therapy (already doing)
	- Breathwork/Qi Gong (regulate Lung/po)
	- May need multiple treatments
	- Gradual emotional release safest
- Essential Element: Clarity
- Clarity of:
	- Area - where is the condition?
	- Points - which points along pathways?
	- Strategic selection - how to choose points?
	- Strategic Point Selection
- Both art and science:
- Science:
	- Understand pathways
	- Know point functions
	- Apply classical theory
- Art:
	- Intuition about point selection
	- Sense of how many points needed
	- Feel for treatment flow
- Develops through:
	- Study
	- Practice
	- Experience
	- Reflection on results

##### Quick Reference: Main Points Along Divergent Channels
- Table 10.1 in the book provides:
	- Confluent points for each channel pair

	- Create synergy - enhance other treatments
- The Practice
To apply divergent channels effectively:
1. Study pathways thoroughly
	- Know where they go
	- Understand connections
	- Memorize confluent points
2. Treat entire pathways
	- Not just 1-2 points
	- Multiple points along route
	- Comprehensive stimulation
3. Apply proper technique
	- Reinforce when reinforcing
	- Reduce when reducing
	- Clear intention and method
4. Plan treatment order
	- Exact sequence matters
	- Creates healing synergy
	- Sends clear message to body
5. Combine modalities
	- Moxibustion, gua sha, cupping
	- Enhances effectiveness
	- Provides additional outlets

- The Author's Experience
	- "I have found the divergent channels to be one of the most useful and effective channel systems in clinical practice."
- Success comes from:
	- Understanding theory
	- Knowing pathways
- Strategic point selection
	- Proper technique
	- Clinical experience
