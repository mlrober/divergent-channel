# Core Principle
- Pathogens can transfer FROM other channels INTO divergent channels
- Divergent Channels can influence ALL areas they connect to
- The flow goes BOTH WAYS: Imbalances flow in; treatment flows out

# Seven Clinical Applications
- Treat Conditions along divergent pathways
	- Divergent channels reach areas primary channels don'they
		- E.g. Spine or Internal organs directly
- Treat associated internal organs
	- Each Yin or Yang pair connects to related organs
	- Direct organ influence distinguishes them from muscle channels
- Treat primary channel conditions
	- Support Primary Channel treatments
- Treat Connecting (luo) Channel conditions
	- Especially emotional conditions
	- Blood channels hold emotions
- Treat Muscle (Sinew) channel conditions
	- Musculoskeletal issues, bi syndrome
- Treat Bone-level conditions
	- Connect to Eight Extraordinary Vessels
	- Influence Jing (Essence)

 # Layer Integration
- Divergent channels are unique because they influence:
	- Wei layer (superficial: skin, muscles)
	- Ying layer (middle: primary channels, organs)
	- Yuan layer (deep: extraordinary channels, jing)

# 8 Essential Qualities
1. Branch from primary channels
- Diverge at specific points
- Return to rejoin primary channels
2. Flow through major joints
- Joints are large spaces
- Spaces where pathogens can lodge
- Knees, hips, shoulders, elbows
3. Ascending flow
- Begin at knees (Bladder-Kidney)
- Move up to hip → chest → shoulders → throat → face
- Exception: San Jiao descends from head
- This ascending function moves substances and pathogens upward/outward
4. Move bidirectionally
- Outward movement: Releases pathogenic factors
- Inward movement: Reinforces organs, maintains latency
- Can guide body's substances to specific areas
5. Distribute qi to head region
- Neck, face, head, sensory organs
- All six pairs reach the head area
6. Flow superficially AND deeply
- Cover areas primary channels don't reach
- Influence wei (superficial), ying (middle), and yuan (deep) layers
7. Have no points of their own
- Share points with primary channels
- Pathway intersections become treatment points
8. Strengthen Yin-Yang connections
- Unite paired channels
- Can influence internal organs directly

# Roots and Ends
- Different from confluent points! These show where pathogens can enter divergent channels

| Channel | Root (Begin) | End | Anatomical Area |
| Tai Yang | BL-67 | BL-1 | Eyes |
| Shao Yang | GB-44 | SI-19 | Ear |
| Yang Ming | ST-45 | ST-8 | Corner of head |
| Tai Yin | SP-1 | Ren-12 | Stomach |
| Shao Yin | KD-1 | Ren-23 | Throat |
| Jue Yin | LV-1 | Ren-17 | Chest |

## Clinical Application
- Use BOTH confluent points AND root/end points
- Roots begin on extremities (no confluent points there)
- Provides additional treatment entry points

- From Ling Shu:
- For one who comprehends ends and beginnings, one sentence is enough.
- For one who does not understand ends and beginnings, the way of the needle is completely cut off.

# Always treat the entire pathway, not just 1-2 points!

## Luo Connecting Channels
- Emotions are stored in the blood, and the connecting channels treat blood.
	- Connecting channels treat emotions
	- Channels influencing connecting channels (like divergent) also treat emotions

| Channel | Excess |  Deficiency |
| Lung | Heat in wrist/palm | Yawning, frequent urination |
| Heart | Fullness/pressure in chest/diaphragm | Loss of speech |
| Pericardium | Heart painVexation in Heart |
| Large Intestine | Toothache, deafness | Teeth sensitive to cold, bi conditions |
| Small Intestine | Joint loosening, lack of muscle tone at elbow | Small swelling |
| San Jiao | Elbow muscle spasms/cramps | Lack of elbow muscle tone |
| Stomach | Counterflow qi, throat bi, sudden voice loss | Foot/shin lack of tone/withering |
| Bladder | Nasal congestion with clear discharge, headache, back pain | Clear nasal discharge, nosebleed |
| Gallbladder | Inversion | Lower limb weakness, can't stand from sitting |
| Spleen | Cholera, intestinal stabbing pain | Drum-like abdominal distension | 
| Kidney | Vexation/oppression, constipation, urinary block | Lower back pain |
| Liver | Testicular swelling, abnormal erection | Sudden genital itching |
| Ren | Abdominal skin pain | Abdominal skin itching |
| Du | Back rigidity | Head heaviness, head shaking |
| Great Luo of Spleen | Whole body aching/pain | Looseness of hundred joints |

## TRANSVERSE CONNECTING CHANNELS
- Treat source point of one channel + luo point of its Yin-Yang pair
- Example
	- LU-9 (source) + LI-6 (luo)
	- ST-42 (source) + SP-4 (luo)

### How Divergent Channels Support Primary & Connecting Channels

1. Organ Conditions
- Primary channels connect to organs
- Divergent channels also connect to organs
- Treating divergent channels supports organ treatment
2. Channel Conditions
- Primary channel imbalances
- Divergent channels can assist clearing/reinforcing
3. Emotional Conditions
- Connecting channels hold emotions in blood
- Divergent channels can help release emotions
- Combined treatment creates powerful effect
4. Yin-Yang Synergy
- Classical principle
	- Combining two or more channels creates stronger reaction than treating one channel
	- Divergent channels + primary channels = enhanced treatment

### CLINICAL EXAMPLE: Combining Channels
- Condition
	- Chronic Liver fire with repressed anger
- Treatment Strategy
	- Connecting channel treatment
		- Plum blossom LV-5 and GB-37 (luo points) 
			- releases emotions from blood
	- Divergent channel treatment
		- LV/GB divergent channels 
			- brings emotional energy to surface
	- Primary channel treatment
		- LV-3 (source point) 
			- regulates Liver qi
- Result
	- Divergent channels guide the energy upward/outward, connecting channels provide outlet, primary channels regulate organ - synergistic healing

### Diagnosis Determines Treatment
- Know which channels are affected
	- Location of pain/symptoms
	- Time of occurrence
	- Emotional component
	- Organ involvement

### Never Treat in Isolation
- Modern practice often uses only primary channels. Classical practice:
	- Identifies ALL affected channels
	- Treats multiple systems synergistically
	- Creates comprehensive healing response

### Nourishing QI Cycle (Daily Meridian Clock)
- Cycle Flows like 3-5 AM Lungs -> Liver (1-3 AM)

# Muscle Channels and 12 Months

| Month | Muscle Channel | Susceptibility |
| January | Gallbladder | More vulnerable | this month |
| February | Bladder | More vulnerable | this month |
| March | Stomach | More vulnerable | this month |
| April | Large Intestine | More vulnerable | this month |
| May | Small Intestine | More vulnerable | this month |
| June | San Jiao | More vulnerable | this month |
| July | Kidney | More vulnerable | this month |
| August | Spleen | More vulnerable | this month |
| September | Liver | More vulnerable | this month |
| October | Pericardium | More vulnerable | this month |
| November | Lung | More vulnerable | this month |
| December | Heart | More vulnerable | this month |

## Diagnostic Tool
Diagnostic Tool:
- Condition appears/worsens during specific month?
- Check that month's channel/organ

## Preventive Treatment
- Treat channel during its month
- Strengthen before vulnerability period
- Example
	- Patient with chronic anger issues → most severe in September → Liver is September channel → confirms Liver diagnosis

## Two Functions of Divergent Channel
1. Release pathogens FROM muscle channels
- Heat, cold, wind, damp lodged in muscles
- Divergent channels move them outward
- Combined with muscle channel treatment

2. Release pathogens IN divergent channels
- That transferred from muscle channels
- Move outward to exterior
- Release from body

3. Treatment Strategy
- Divergent channel treatment (move pathogen outward)
- Muscle channel treatment (release from body)
	- Add modality: gua sha, cupping, plum blossom

## Hour of Birth Method
- 
### Hour Branch and Stem Table
| Time            | Organ / Channel       | Source Point |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 11 pm – 1 am    | Gallbladder           | GB-40        |
| 1 am – 3 am     | Liver                 | LV-3         |
| 3 am – 5 am     | Lung                  | LU-9         |
| 5 am – 7 am     | Large Intestine       | LI-4         |
| 7 am – 9 am     | Stomach               | ST-42        |
| 9 am – 11 am    | Spleen                | SP-3         |
| 11 am – 1 pm    | Heart                 | HT-7         |
| 1 pm – 3 pm     | Small Intestine       | SI-4         |
| 3 pm – 5 pm     | Bladder               | BL-64        |
| 5 pm – 7 pm     | Kidney                | KD-3         |
| 7 pm – 9 pm     | Pericardium           | PC-7         |
| 9 pm – 11 pm    | San Jiao              | SJ-4         |

- Clinical Application
	- Diagnosis
		- Person born 5-7 pm → Kidney time
		- Susceptible to Kidney conditions throughout life

## Diagnostic Quests for Chronic Conditions
- What time do symptoms occur? (meridian clock)
- What time after waking? (wei qi cycle)
- What month worse? (muscle channel cycle)
- What hour of birth? (constitutional)

# Five Shen Model

| Organ    | Shen | Element | Virtue                         | Emotion (Imbalanced)                                   | Storehouse of | Shelters |
|----------|------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Heart    | Shen | Fire    | Joy, Love                      | Hastiness, Impatience, Hatred, Arrogance, Cruelty      | channels | shen (Spirit) |
| Spleen  | Yi   | Earth   | Openness                      | Worry, Pensiveness, Obsessiveness, Jealousy            | Nourishment | Yi (thoght) |

### Two-Way Relationship
- Organ → Shen
	- Organ condition influences shen (psychology/spirit)
	- Example: Chronic Kidney deficiency → fear manifests
- Shen → Organ
	- Psychological state influences organ
	- Example: Constant stress → Liver stagnation → anger/irritability
- This is the body-mind unity in Chinese medicine.

	- For both practitioner and patient
- The Goal
	- Attune to Heart shen
	- Direct experience of spirit
	- Realize unity of life (Wu Wei)
	- Live from this awareness

## 2. THE ZHI (志 - Kidney Will)
#### Location & Function
- Kidneys house the zhi:
	- Corresponds to jing (essence)
	- Genetics and ancestral influences
	- Pre-natal essence
	- Willpower
#### Ancestral Influences
- Two Types:
	1. Genetic (Biological):
		- DNA from parents/ancestors
		- Physical constitution
		- Inherited tendencies
	2. Cultural/Environmental (Post-Natal Early Life):
		- Culture, religion, beliefs of family
		- Caretaker influences
		- Early life conditioning
		- Both shape the zhi and must be transcended for fulfillment.
#### The Nature of Zhi
- Willpower:
	- Will and power to follow destiny
	- Ability to fulfill life purpose
- Kidneys loathe cold:
	- Cold freezes water
	- Changes essential nature
	- Blocks adaptability
- Freezing/Rigidity from:
	- Ancestral influences (genetic)
	- Early life conditioning
	- Blocks expression of destiny
	- Prevents flowing, adaptive nature
#### The Kidney-Heart Connection
- Kidney channel flows:
	- Up anterior body to chest
	- Creates front shu points (12 shu points of chest, Su Wen Chapter 58)
	- Zhi seeking Shen
	- Built-in energetic system
- If zhi is frozen:
	- Can't fulfill destiny
	- Can't reach Heart shen
	- Rigidity blocks natural flow
#### Water & Unlimited Potential
- Zhi and jing represent:
	- Chaos/Wu Ji - state where anything is possible
	- Field of spontaneity
	- No limits
	- Unlimited possibilities
	- Blueprint of life/destiny code
When expressed fully:
	- Zhi unfolds naturally
	- Destiny is fulfilled
	- Living from essential nature
When frozen/blocked:
	- Ancestral/family influences create rigidity
	- Inability to be open to all possibilities
	- Kidneys and zhi unfavorably affected
### The Destiny Code
- Zhi contains:
	- Blueprint of life
	- Destiny code
	- Pre-natal potential
- Allowing zhi to unfold = fulfilling destiny
- Internal alchemy (nei dan):
	- Accelerates personal development
	- Allows immersion and expression
	- Accelerates unfolding process
	- Burns karma (cause and effect)
#### Physical Manifestations
- Kidneys open to the ears:
	- Hearing conditions (physical)
	- Not hearing/understanding what others say (perceptual)
	- Communication disconnection

## 3. THE HUN (魂 - Liver Ethereal Soul)
#### Location & Function
	- Liver houses the hun:
		- Ethereal soul
		- Collective consciousness
		- "We" aspect of awareness
		- Community and unity
#### The Collective Nature
- Balanced Hun Expression:
	- Working with others for community benefit
	- Concern for collective/society
	- Unity consciousness
	- Putting oneself in situations benefiting others
- Why Important:
	- Allows awareness of interconnection
	- Opportunity to learn and grow
	- Expression of hun temperament
	- Imbalanced Expressions
- If hun blocked:
	- Acts contrary to temperament
	- Selfish behavior (opposite of unity/community)
	- Blocked expression creates stagnation
- If hun excessive:
	- Too attached to collective (at cost of self-care)
	- Neglects own health and well-being
	- Rising/flying away (escape from body/life)
	- Rejecting personal life
	- Balance is key!
#### Planning & Future Orientation
- Hun relates to:
	- Planning
	- Thinking of future
	- How to achieve goals
	- Vision and direction
- Imbalanced:
	- Excessive planning/worry about future

	- Loss of present moment awareness
#### Physical Manifestations
- Liver opens to the eyes:
	- Vision problems (physical)
	- Lack of perceiving (perceptual)
	- Lack of insight or inner seeing
	- Not just eyesight—perception itself
#### Treatment Implications
- When hun imbalanced:
	- Treatment plan to unblock stagnations
	- Allow natural expression of constitutional temperament
	- Release from body and channels (divergent channels useful)
	- Restore balance between self and collective

## 4. THE PO (魄 - Lung Corporeal Soul)
#### Location & Function
- Lungs house the po:
	- Corporeal soul
	- Relates to physical body
	- Senses, desires, emotions
	- "Me" aspect of self
#### The Physical Attachment
- Po corresponds to:
	- Senses (seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling)
	- Desires (physical pleasures)
	- Emotions (felt in body)
	- Physical body itself
- Imbalanced:
	- Over-attachment to physical/sensory
	- Selfishness ("me, me, me")
	- Greediness
	- Focus on physical/self-pleasure
#### The Channel of Polarity
- Large Intestine channel:
	- Only primary channel crossing body midline
	- "Channel of polarity"
- Polarized Po creates:
	- Separation from others
	- Separation from society
	- Separation from creator/life itself
	- Isolation and loneliness
#### The Loneliness Paradox
- Process:
	- Po polarizes itself
	- Creates separation
	- Intensified loneliness results
	- Loneliness creates response
	- Seeking another way to live
	- Body's innate intelligence seeks homeostasis
- This can initiate change and transformation!
#### Breathing & Present Moment
- Lungs connected to nose:
	- Breathing is key to bringing po to present moment
	- Frees from polarity
	- No polarity exists in current moment
	- Polarity only in thoughts of past/future
- Practices:
	- Breathing exercises
	- Qi Gong
	- Tai Chi Chuan
	- Regulate breath
	- Calm po
	- Promote balance
#### Balanced Po Expression
- Healthy po:
	- Enjoying physical body
	- Appreciating sensory experiences
	- Self-care (not selfishness)
	- Being present in body
- Imbalanced:
	- Selfish, greedy
	- Neglecting/ignoring body
	- Polarization
	- Separation
#### Treatment Strategy
- For po imbalance:
	- Connecting channel treatment (release emotions)
	- Divergent channel treatment (Lung/Large Intestine)
	- Breathwork
	- Bring awareness to present moment
