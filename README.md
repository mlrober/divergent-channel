# Different Types of Channels
- Cutaneous Channels (Skin level)
- Muscle (Sinews) Channels
- Connecting (Luo) Channels
- Primary (Superficial) channels
- Divergent (Separate) Channels
- Eight Extraordinary Channels

# Six Junctions (Confluences)
- Each junction pairs a Yang and Yin channels

## 1st Junction: Bladder & Kidney Channel
- Bladder Divergent
	- Separates at Knee (Ub-40)
	- Enters at anus
	- Connect to Bladder and spreads to kidney
	- Follows Spine to heart area
	- Exits at neck -> rejoins at Ub10
- Kidney Divergent
	- Connects at knee with bladder
	- Reaches kidneys at L2 (Du-4)
	- Connects Dai Mai (Belt Channel)
	- Branch to root of tongue
	- Exits at neck -> Joins Bladder at (UB-10)
- Confluence Points
	- Bl40 (Earth) & Bl10 (Heaven)

## 2nd Junction: GallBladder & Liver (Wood Element)
- GallBladder Divergent
	- Winds around thigh and enters pubic region
	- Connects to Gallbladder and liver
	- Passes through Heart and Emerges at throat/jaw/face
	- Connects to eye -> Joins at GB-1
- Liver Divergent
	- Separates at top of foot and ascends to pubic region
	- Joins Gallbladder Channel
- Confluent Points
	- Ren2 or GB30 (Earth), GB1 (Heaven)

## 3rd Junction: Stomach & Spleen
- Stomach Divergent
	- Ascends to thigh and Enters abdomen
	- Connects to stomach and spreads to spleen
	- Penetrates Heart and Flows to throat/mouth/nose/forehead
	- Connects Eye -> Joins at St-1 or Bl-1
- Spleen Divergent
	- Ascends to Buttocks and Joins stomach channel
	- Connects to throat and Passes through root of tongue
- Confluent Points
	- St-30 (Earth) and Bl-1/St-1/Li-20 (Heaven)

## 4th Junction: Small Intestine and Heart Channel
- Small Intestine Divergent
	- Separates from Scapula and enters armpit
	- Reaches heart and connects to Small intestine
- Heart Divergent
	- Enters Armpit area and links to Heart
	- Ascends to throat and emerges at face
	- Joins at Bl-1
- Confluent Points	
	- GB-22 (earth) and BL-1 (Heaven)
	
## 5th Junction: Triple Warmer & Pericardium Channel
- Triple Warmer
	- Descends from Head and Enters supraclavicular fossa (St-12)
	- Descends through Triple Heater and scatters in chest
- Pericardium
	- Separates 3 Cun below armpit and Enters chest center
	- Links to Triple heater and runs along throat
	- Exits behind ear -> joins below mastoid process
- Confluent Points
	- Ren-12 (Earth) and Tw-16/GB-12 (Heaven)

## 6th Junction: Large Intestine & Lung (Metal Element)
- Large Intestine
	- Flows from hand to chest and separates to shoulder/clavicle
	- Descends to Large Intestine and connects to Lungs
	- Flows along throat -> joins at St-12
- Lungs Divergent
	- Separates, passes to armpit and links to Lungs
	- Flows to Large Intestine and ascends to supraclavicular fossa
	- Returns to Join Large Intestine Channel
- Confluent Points
	- ST-12 (earth) and LI-18 (Heaven)

# Core Principle
- Pathogens can transfer FROM other channels INTO divergent channels
- Divergent Channels can influence ALL areas they connect to
- The flow goes BOTH WAYS: Imbalances flow in; treatment flows out

# Seven Clinical Applications
- Treat Conditions along divergent pathways
	- Divergent channels reach areas primary channels don'they
		- E.g. Spine or Internal organs directly
- Treat associated internal organs
	- Each Yin or Yang pair connects to related organs
	- Direct organ influence distinguishes them from muscle channels
- Treat primary channel conditions
	- Support Primary Channel treatments
- Treat Connecting (luo) Channel conditions
	- Especially emotional conditions
	- Blood channels hold emotions
- Treat Muscle (Sinew) channel conditions
	- Musculoskeletal issues, bi syndrome
- Treat Bone-level conditions
	- Connect to Eight Extraordinary Vessels
	- Influence Jing (Essence)
